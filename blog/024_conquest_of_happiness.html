            <h1><em>The Conquest of Happiness</em> by Bertrand Russell</h1>

                “We are all prone to the malady of the introvert, who, with the manifold spectacle of the world spread out before him, turns away and gazes only upon the emptiness within.” (p. 160)

                Bertrand Russell was a philosopher and mathematician of the early 20th century, but the Conquest of Happiness is less analytical than practical, containing his advice on how to live better. Russell suffered from want of happiness in his childhood, so his cure is tailored for himself, though I think it generalizes well. The book is divided into two parts: Causes of Unhappiness and Causes of Happiness.

                The causes of unhappiness can mostly be placed under the umbrella of self-absorption. Russell gives three main archetypes of self-absorbed personalities: the sinner, the narcissist, and the megalomaniac. The sinner is not self-absorbed because of his sins per se, but for relentlessly thinking about how everything he does proves how much of a sinner he is. While introspection can be a virtue, that is only true insofar as one uses it for self-improvement. Rumination, while perhaps coming from a good place, only serves to make one unhappy. I like the term Augustine of Hippo used for this: incurvatus in se, curved inwards toward oneself. The narcissist is the classic case of self-absorption. She only sees the world in terms of how it affects her life; she admires herself and desires the admiration of others. Wide admiration is unattainable for most, and even if it is achieved gives limited satisfaction. Most children are narcissists; some do not grow out of it. The megalomaniac is not quite as self-absorbed as the other two because he at least tries to mold the world as he sees fit. However, he is commanded by his ego and desire for power, which is unsatiable and leads to unhappiness.

                Russell devotes chapters on unhappiness to persecution mania, fatigue, envy, competition, boredom, and others, but I think that the root of all these lies with the self. I think this applies to my life and many others in the modern world, but of course it neglects the terrible living conditions that are unfortunately still commonplace today. It goes without saying that the victims are not responsible for their condition in these cases, but the path to happiness for them is not the concern of this book. Russell includes an interesting theory on why fatigue is so rampant these days: that seeing so many strangers everyday is tiring. We are wired to evaluate every stranger we meet to decide how to treat them, depending on if they are a friend or foe. He also says that one can reduce anxiety by acknowledging that the universe will go on regardless of the outcome of the anxiety-producing event in question. I agree, but I also think that some anxiety is useful and that is is beneficial to learn to accept and live with it.

                I read Russell as presenting a list of necessary but not sufficient conditions for happiness in the second half of the book. He does not explicitly present them this way since this is not a work of philosophy but one of practicality. These conditions include zest, affection, family, and work. Zest is essential to a happy life, and is purely a mindset. Two men can experience the exact same events, but the one with a zest for life will get more pleasure from the pleasurable and more excitement or knowledge from misfortune. However, zest must be tempered by moderation, as overindulgence in anything occurs at the expense of everything else. Zest is closely tied to affection – love promotes zest more than anything else. It is important to both give and receive affection, and it also promotes sex which ties into the family. Russell spends considerable time on why starting a family isn’t as attractive of a prospect for women these days because they can earn their own wages and not be dependent on men. But even in other countries where this norm doesn’t exist, he notes that the more civilized a nation becomes the fewer children it produces. This is still a problem today, and Russell doesn’t propose any solutions other than to make raising a family lead to more happiness than it does currently. Work, as with any virtue, can be both a blessing and a curse. It can cure boredom, be an outlet for ambition, and give life a consistent purpose, but it can also be physically and/or mentally harmful, take over life to an unhealthy extent, and simply be boring. Russell says the best work requires both skill and construction. Work is not necessary for happiness per se, but the continuing purpose it can provide is.</p>

                Russell says that another factor in happiness is the equilibrium between effort and resignation. Effort is good because you need to act in the world rather than retreat inwards. Resignation can be good because there are things that are out of your control that are not productive to fret over. However, some people become resigned out of despair, and this is destructive because they stop trying to achieve great things. He also mentions that the little things, like hobbies, are important for relaxation and temporary distraction. An interest in things, as opposed to people, is also good because it expands your interests outside of yourself. However, hobbies are often used as an escape from reality. This is fine when dealing with a tragedy, but is often taken too far. Relationships with people form a more fundamental happiness.

                Once you have cured yourself of self-absorption, your nature and circumstances will give rise to interests naturally. A common worry for young people is that they don’t know what to do with their lives. Russell says to become absorbed in something before committing to it, which many people do in the wrong order. In summary, “The secret of happiness is this: let your interests be as wide as possible, and let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be as far as possible friendly rather than hostile.” (p. 157)
