          <h1><em>The Secret of Our Success</em>, by Joseph Henrich</h1>
          <p>10/7/21</p>
          <p>
            Joseph Henrich's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25761655-the-secret-of-our-success"><em>The Secret of Our Success: How Culture is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter</em></a> is one of those books that gets brought up so often by people I respect that I knew it was inevitable I would eventually read it. I thought I'd jot down my key takeaways from memory (it's been about a week since I finished) to 1. help me encode what I learned and 2. give me something to look back upon when the details start to get hazy.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Cultural evolution significantly impacted our genetic evolution
              <p>
                The canonical view goes something likes this: genes -> biology/psychology -> culture. Culture is seen as a product of our big brains, which is a product of our genes. Henrich's claim is that throughout our evolution, and even before homo sapiens, culture has directly and significantly affected our genes.

              <p>
                Memorable examples: sweat glands (water retention is less important since we can store water in containers, so we can afford to use it to cool ourselves off), lactose tolerance (cultures that learned to use dairy products very rapidly developed this tolerance), smaller digestive tract, fewer muscles, and smaller mouths (as we outsourced much of our digestion to the environment - fire, cutting, mashing, and other utensils)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Humans are smarter than other animals, but most of this difference is due to accumulated cultural knowledge rather than innate knowledge
              <p>
                See studies of young chimps vs infants. Infants are no better than young chimps at most tasks, but continue to learn while chimps stagnate. A negative example that came to mind that wasn't discussed in the book is that of feral children - the unfortunate case of children who were abandoned or suffered extreme neglect from their parents and were not able to learn even the most basic human behaviors.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Humans in developed societies are not inherently smarter than those in aboriginal societies, they just have a different cultural skillset
            </li>
            <p>
              The most entertaining parts of the book were Henrich's fantastic accounts of explorers getting lost in the arctic, America (New World), and other places where (relevantly encultured) humans have no trouble living. Time and time again these intelligent and fit men in their prime starved to death surrounded by food sources that they couldn't figure out how to access.
            </p>
            <li>
              It is possible to lose important knowledge given a significant disruptor
            </li>
            <p>
              Ex. <a href="https://archive.org/details/disappearanceofu00riveiala"><em>The Disappearance of Useful Arts</em></a> - boats, bows, pottery - in societies in the Pacific islands. There have even been societies that have lost the ability to make fire. If this seems too incredible to be true, when's the last time you made a fire? Lose enough propagators of cultural knowledge and that knowledge can be lost indefinitely.
            </p>
            <li>
              Dominance hierarchies (which still exist in humans) are common in other species but prestige hierarchies are a unique attribute of human society
              <p>
                In dominance hierarchies, one makes progress through violence and the threat of violence. This affords the individual greater access to food and mates. One gains prestige by having skills or knowledge that other members of the group find valuable. Younger members benefit by learning learning/improving their hunting, foraging, water-finding, and other skills and older members benefit by gaining status they would otherwise lose in older age.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Humans have not stopped evolving or started evolving "backwards" as we begin to cure diseases and prevent malnutrion (as I myself, admittedly, hypothesized as an undergrad)
            </li>
            <p>
              A (not so) clever Homo Erectus could have made the same argument when she noticed her friends losing their muscles and intestines as technologies such as fire and tools were developed. Sure, we are evolving/devolving traits as we rely on technology more but what is the alternative, not using technology at all?
            </p>
          </ol>
          <p>
            I found Henrich's book to be compelling and well written. Popular science books often contain one big new idea (if we're lucky) that the author milks for everything it's worth, leading to an initially exciting book that trails off as the stories get less compelling and more repetitive. The Secret of Our Success doesn't suffer from this malady as others in the class, but I did find the final chapters on the origin of culture and why humans developed it as opposed to other species to be less compelling than the rest of the book.
