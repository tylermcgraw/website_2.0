<h1>Vegan Protein Sources</h1>
<p>10/24/21</p>
<p>
    A couple months ago I started eating a predominantly vegetarian diet, and a month later transitioned to a mostly vegan diet. (I still eat animal-based food once or twice a month when out with friends) As a lifter I was aware that plant-based proteins are, in general, of a lower quality than animal-based proteins (meaning that they have a poorer amino acid profile and lower digestability) but I switched for ethical and environmental reasons rather than health reasons and so was willing to bite the bullet. I took the general recommendation for lifters of .7g protein/lb bodyweight (130g for me) and bumped it up to 150 to account for protein quality. I haven't noticed a difference in my performance or general well-being since going plant-based and have been pleasantly suprised at how manageable it is to eat enough protein.

    On the average day I eat ~3000 calories and ~160g protein. The majority of my protein comes from soy products, though legumes and whole wheat make up a good chunk as well. Other sources include mushrooms and nutritional yeast, though these are probably more valuable for their micronutrient contributions.

        Soy<br>
	I've always loved milk so soy milk has obviously taken over that role in my diet (primarily as a medium for cereal and Oreos). Most other plant-based milks are low in protein (oat, almond); others such as flaxseed milk are proteinous but in my opinion need serious improvement in the taste department. Tofu is the most well-known soy food and is a great source of protein. I prefer firm/extra-firm tofu for the texture and because it has significantly more protein than its soft/silkier cousins (twice as much at the same price where I am). Not everyone knows that edamame are immature soybeans and so have a surprisingly high amount of protein.

        Whole wheat<br>
  I was surprised to learn how much protein whole wheat foods can have. The bread I eat has 5g protein per 70 calories and the tortillas 6g per 60 calories. These are just regular whole wheat options, you can probably find protein boosted versions of these foods. Cereal and oatmeal generally don't have as much protein but there is certainly variation across products. Vital wheat gluten (seitan) has an incredible 23g per 120 calories and is commonly used as a vegan meat substitute, but I have been combining it with nutritional yeast to make protein dense bread.

        Legumes and nuts<br>
  I'm not a huge fan of beans but they are a good option. Peas are quite good, though you need to eat a large volume if they're your main source of protein. Pea protein powder is very high quality - pea + rice powder is just as effective as whey (the gold standard of supplements). Nuts are a good source but since they are high in fat they probably shouldn't be your primary source of protein. The same applies to nut butter spreads, altough there are low-fat versions such as PB Lite.

        Mushrooms<br>
  Whole mushrooms are low in calories and so necessarily low in protein, but there are some great commercial mycoproteins that are more protein dense. Mushrooms also have important micronutrients commonly lacking in vegan diets.

	<li>
        Nutritional yeast<br>
  High in protein but more of a supplementary food rather than a primary protein source. Commonly fortified with vitamin B12 and other micronutrients commonly lacking in a plant-based diet (as are some cereals and milks).
	</li>

        Other<br>
  Fruits, vegetables, grains, and other foods I eat also contain protein but not in nearly enough quantity to be worth mentioning. Notably missing from my list are grains such as quinoa and brown rice and impossible/beyond/other commercial faux meats. These are good options but the grains are not high enough in protein and the commercial options are not worth the price tag in my opinion.

    I do not eat protein supplements, but pea + rice powder is very good if you are struggling to get enough protein from whole foods. This also addresses a potential concern of plant-based diets and "anti-nutrients" such as fiber which may inhibit nutrient digestion. I don't think amino acid profiles are worth getting into the weeds over unless you are really trying to maximize muscle growth, but a good rule of thumb is to mix protein sources to balance the weakness of any one food - for example I eat cereal with soy milk and a couple peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on whole wheat bread for breakfast so I get corn, legumes, and wheat protein in one meal.
