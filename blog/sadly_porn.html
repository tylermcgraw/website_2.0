<h1><em>Sadly, Porn</em> by Edward Teach</h1>
<p>6/26/22</p>
<p>
    What drives someone to write a 1,000 page book about porn? [1] Certainly not the desire to be widely read. Edward Teach, aka Alone, aka The Last Psychiatrist, all pseudonyms of a former blogger, says this is a feature rather than a bug, which is why he added to the obfuscation by using a small font, not using an editor, and putting a 30 page porn story at the front of the book. [2]  He doesn’t explain why; one possibility is to weed out the weak, like an intro pre-med class. Perhaps the book as a whole serves as a lesson contained in the book: that knowledge is a defense against action.
</p>
<p>
    My read, as someone who only discovered TLP’s blog years after he stopped posting, is that the reason he writes is partly for himself, but mostly to help other people who have similar deficiencies to his own. His writing is filled with prescriptive messages to the reader, but his diagnoses are all the same. ““So the book is a symptom of society’s pathology?” No. If it involves public media, that is not how it works. The book is the defense.” (p. 585/829) A defense against what? “I can squat 315x5 like anybody else, the difference is what I wanted was a physical hour to listen to math lectures, so I could write a book about pornography, so I wouldn’t destroy the lives of the people around me.” (p. 724/829) [3] I don’t know how this book helps him accomplish that goal but there it is. What about for the reader: what is this book a defense against? The following is a list of the book’s theses, which may or may not help answer this question.
</p>
<p>
    <b>You are a narcissist.</b><br>
    Narcissism is what TLP is famous for analyzing on his blog. It is assumed that the reader is a narcissist and the book’s analyses proceed from this axiom. ““Will this book help me learn more about myself?” Ugh. The whole earth is sick of your search for knowledge. In here you will not find explanations, I am not offering you information, this is an attempt to destroy the wisdom of the wise and frustrate the intelligence of the intelligent.” (p. 10/829)
</p>
<p>
    <b>Knowledge is the defense against impotence.</b><br>
    So, you are a narcissist. Why are you reading this book? To learn more about yourself, TLP answers for you. Why are you trying to learn more about yourself? Because you are impotent, and have proceeded to repress this uncomfortable thought. This feeling was sublimated into over-intellectualization and the search for self-knowledge. “Your knowledge is the trade off for your impotence, and impotence is what you want, so that no one can depend on you. If it’s being taught in university and it doesn’t have numbers in it, it is 100% a defense against change.” (p. 639/829)
</p>
<p>
    <b>Action comes first, then identity.</b><br>
    Not only are you a narcissist, but you are an impotent narcissist who is on a search to find themselves rather than take action. Why? Taking action might solve your problems, but you would have to confront your impotence head on, which is painful. By seeking knowledge, your repressed impotence stays repressed. “The point of the fantasy is not to act. The point of the fantasy is NOT to inspire action – by which I mean, literally, the point of this pornographic fantasy is to not inspire action. It slyly assures you of what you could be capable of, if you were forced to act. Watching this fantasy spares the audience from having to act on their own failings or lives or dreams, it relieves them of this pressure by assuring them that they could, because they know how.” (p. 444/829)
</p>
<p>
    <b>Your desires are not yours.</b><br>
    You adopt a fantasy rather than striving for your desires. Over time your desires become replaced by the desires of others because the fantasy you adopted was not yours. Hence the loss of identity, and the search for self-knowledge. “She has forgotten how to want. When she reliably avoids acting on her desire, her desires change, from what she wants to what others want of her; from what satisfies her to a defense against it.” (p. 458/829)
</p>
<p>
    <b>Defending against change</b><br>
    “No, you insist, “I really do want to make a change.” Are you sure? “As a child you were offered the appearance of novelty as an escape from boredom, but quite quickly you discovered it as an excellent defense against dependency, against change. “I’m kind of a news junkie, there’s so much happening right now it’s hard to keep up with it.” Yet no one depends on you keeping up with it, they’d benefit much more if you didn’t. Devotion to something with the appearance of importance, of velocity, of kinetic energy; that you don’t really need, that you can always claim in an emergency doesn’t “actually” define you. “This stuff doesn’t really matter,” you say as you watch the xth hour or push the nth button, “but right now I’m satisfied.” Look around you to see who you’ve deprived.” (p. 553/829)
</p>
<p>
    <b>Balancing the ledger</b><br>
    “Deprived? Why would I want to do that?” Because you are powerless; you don’t have the ability to get what you want from the world. Therefore, “if you can’t exert power over others, the only satisfaction you can get is depriving them of the only thing you have: yourself.” (p. 328/829) All of your relationships can be summarized as the balancing of ledgers.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Defending against dependency</b><br>
    Your collection of knowledge, your therapy sessions, your games, none of it leads to real change. You’re the same person searching under a different rock. And your refusal to change leads you to avoiding the dependence of others “Power imbalances, structural forces; mindfulness, purposeful living; connectedness, loving yourself first. But nowhere: how to love someone else. A collective defense against dependency.” (p. 185/829)
</p>
<p>
    <b>Raising the next generation</b><br>
    “The reason the dismantling of love is so important to identify isn’t because a generation of adult men and women are lost, but because they are raising the next generation, terribly. It doesn’t mean they don’t love their kids, as far as it goes, it means that what they want for them is conflicted, ambivalent – and it is this emotional ambivalence, not harsh or absent parenting, that teaches impotence; the verbal hyperinvolvement masking distractibility, boredom, emotional disengagement.” (p. 185/829) Do you want to raise better kids or be a better parent? There’s a difference. 
</p>
<p>
    I tried to connect the above theses together into a story. The next two don’t fit in anywhere but I thought were relevant.
</p>
<p>
    <b>If you’re reading it, it’s for you.</b><br>
    ““Why so many footnotes????” Which is the same question as, “why are your sentences so long, why so many commas, what the hell is with you and semicolons?” It’s all on purpose, to get rid of readers. You’re stumped by the layout? This book is not for you” (p. 329/829) The punctuation is just the beginning – I already mentioned the risqué topics and sheer length of the book. Plus it only had around 30 reviews on Goodreads the last I checked; one does not come across such a niche work by accident. And yet I read most of the words in this book. I skimmed towards the end (which included an original screen play and score) and small sections throughout, but for the most part I think I understood TLP’s rants.     
</p>
<p>
    <b>Read primary sources.</b><br>
    “Because basically I don’t care whether I’m right or wrong, I just want you to read Thucydides – not just apathetically but on purpose, for a purpose, with the desire to be able to use it like a weapon.” (p. 489/829) One could take this at face value. But it is also notable that the book does not include a single source. I suspect that is because of TLP’s laziness, but it could also be intentional. Perhaps he thinks that there are no such things as primary sources, there is only the author and reader.
</p>
<p>
    What’s the takeaway? Like my other posts, this collection of words wasn’t meant for anyone else, but if you are interested in any of this stuff TLP has a blog which is perhaps more accessible than this book. I think it has reinforced ideas about action and agency which I had been thinking about earlier, and introduced me to other interesting ideas (narcissism, sublimation) and people (Lacan, Zizek – indirectly).

    [1] The MOBI file lists the book at 829 pages, but the number of pages varies based on the width of the screen. Based on other books I’ve read, that would translate to a page count of around 1,200. However, Alone says that he wrote in small font to annoy the reader, so this is probably an over count. Amazon lists the book at 465 pages but that is the 6.7” x 9.6” inch version. Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution in France is 104 pages at 7” x 10” and 352 at 5” x 7.6”. Sadly, Porn could clock in at well over 1,000 pages if it were printed in duodecimo, in octavo it might not. [a]

<p>
    [2] What’s with all the names? Edward Teach: Blackbeard (TLP often refers to himself as a pirate on his blog), perhaps also something related to teaching (“Ed”, “Teach”). Alone: “I am "Alone." What does that mean? It means that no other characteristic should matter to you, the reader, except that there's only me, whatever that is”. The Last Psychiatrist: a nod to Nietzsche’s last man (as opposed to his Übermensch).

    [3] TLP mentions that he can deadlift twice his weight for 10 reps and 8 times his age for 2. The inside cover says DL 2x2x405, so TLP is likely a ~50 year old psychiatrist who weights ~150 lbs.

    [a] Yes, I really did just learn about Italian printing names to procrastinate. And/or to make myself sound smarter.
