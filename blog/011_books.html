            <h1>Books of Late 2021</h1>

                I am currently reading Jordan Peterson’s <i>12 Rules for Life</i>, Gustave Flaubert’s <i>Madame Bovary</i>, Isaac Asimov’s <i>Chronology of the World</i> and <i>Breakthroughs in Science</i>, Dickens’ <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, Edith Hamilton’s <i>Mythology</i>, and Richard Prum’s <i>The Evolution of Beauty</i>. Adam Smith’s <i>Wealth of Nations</i> and Cesare Becaria’s <i>On Crimes and Punishments</i> are on the backburner for now.

                Since finishing Kierkegaard’s <i>Either/Or</i> in November I have read several books and short stories:

                <h2><em>A Man Without Words</em> by Susan Schaller</h2>
                A fascinating story about Schaller’s experience teaching Ildefonso, a deaf man who grew up without language. At least if your definition of language necessitates the use of abstract symbols, since it is later revealed that Ildefonso communicated with a group of deaf friends by miming. The light bulb moment when Ildefonso finally understood that Susan was trying to use symbols to refer to a real life object, a cat, was breathtaking. The fact that Ildefonso had previously spent his time in class copying the movements of his teachers and peers in a desperate attempt to win their approval lends credit to the fundamentality of mimesis and belonging to human nature.

                <h2><em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> by Arthur Clarke</h2>
                I didn’t get it. The characterization of our pre-human ancestors had no basis in reality. Clarke portrays “Moon Watcher” and his tribe as physical and mental weaklings incapable of hunting. What? Also, if Moon Watcher is 25 and would live for no more than 10 years, then how is it possible that his father was still alive at the beginning of the story? The reason humans are relative weaklings today is that we rely on technology to augment our hunting, digestion, and communication. With neither physical nor mental ability it is a wonder that Clarke’s proto-humans survived long enough to encounter the monolith. At least the movie had epic music and cinematography to heighten the narrative. As for the middle section, it really seemed like a separate story. As a sci-fi horror book/film the whole evil Hal narrative is great, but I didn’t understand how it fit into the greater story. It’s not like the final stage of humanity involved some competition or synthesis with machines. And speaking of the final stage, both the book and movie totally lost me with the whole “Star Child” thing. Ok it symbolizes a rebirth of humanity or whatever, I just personally did not get a sense of awe or sublime or hope for humanity’s future from this representation. Movie: 7/10. Book: 4/10.

                <h2><em>Oliver Twist</em> by Charles Dickens</h2>
                I liked it. Dickens can be a little on the nose but that’s part of the charm. I take away from the book a reminder not to forget the human experience when talking about abstract numbers and statistics. Also a notion of destiny – yes, things finally get better for Oliver and Rose’s name is cleared in the end, but they come from wealthy and successful families and so are merely returning to their “rightful” position. What of poor old Dick, or Nancy?

                <h2><em>The Last Question</em> by Isaac Asimov</h2>
                I like science fiction short stories because to me, sci-fi is all about big ideas and the future rather than allegories about the present. <em>The Last Question</em> has no literary pretensions and covers just about the biggest idea you can imagine. This wasn’t my first reading but the ending still gave me goosebumps.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2><em>The Egg</em> by Andy Weir</h2>
                I also read <em>The Martian</em> and <em>Project Hail Mary</em> from Weir this year, and this 3 page short story tops them both. I guess I just don’t get the hype for his longer works; they were good but highly overrated in my opinion. <em>The Egg</em> is in the same stratosphere as <em>The Last Question</em>, though I have it a notch or two below.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2><em>The Depressed Person</em> by David Foster Wallace</h2>
                Wallace’s frenetic prose gives a window into the pain and anxiety of the depressed person. Incredible and physically uncomfortable to read.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2><em>The Precipice</em> by Toby Ord</h2>
                The Precipice by Toby Ord
                A good analysis of the existential risks facing humanity over the next century (and longer). I have encountered most if not all of the ideas on various blogs and forums but this is a good centralized collection. Ord gives a realistic yet hopeful outlook, but then again how could you do anything else? Pessimists who are convinced the world is ending only make that outcome more likely.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2><em>Interpreter of Maladies</em> by Jhumpa Lapiri</h2>
                A melancholy collection of stories about South Asian immigrants to the United States. An interesting window into the perspectives of others, but I didn’t love how Lapiri’s drab tone made every story so depressing.
