    New York Times Columnist David Brooks' <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40642458-the-second-mountain"><em>The Second Mountain: The Quest for a Moral Life</em></a> has a compelling vision but lackluster execution. Brooks tries to capture the failings of our hyper-individualistic culture as an overemphasis on the "first mountain" of building a career, identity, and prestige. He believes that those of us who know true joy found it on the second mountain, which is conquered by letting the ego submit to personal, spiritual, and communal relationships. I related to many of the problems Brooks laid out in the introductory pages yet found myself disappointed by the rhetoric - mostly personal anecdotes and extensive quotations. Brooks considers himself to always be in the middle - secular vs religious, Jewish vs Catholic, liberal vs conservative. In that vein I view Brooks as being in the middle of other journalist-authors such as Pollan, Gladwell, and Epstein. Pollan's writing is deeply personal; when I read him I feel the emotional and intellectual journey he is on and transfer his experience onto my own. Gladwell and Epstein are more removed, presenting a polished product backed by extensive research meant to disrupt your intuitions. <em>The Second Mountain</em> contains elements of Brooks' personal journey, yet I didn't feel that same connection I feel with Pollan's work. He also attempts to present a solution to a big cultural flaw, but it feels weak and hollow next to Gladwell and Epstein. In my view Brooks had an important personal story to share that is relevant to larger issues of the day, but fell flat on both fronts.

    It pains me to say that because as I mentioned I did relate to many of the problems Brooks outlines. The Pinker-ian view that the world is better off now than in any other time in history is objectively correct but overemphasizes the individual at the expense of the community. Even Montesquieu understood that "doux commerce", the idea that trade promotes peace and tolerance, comes at the price of our humanity. Deeds formerly performed by neighbors and friends have been commoditized. Relationships have become about self-discovery and self-actualization. Religion has been replaced by the personal journey. Vocations have been replaced by careers. In short, the covenant has been replaced by the contract.

    How do we solve these problems? Are they even problems to begin with? Neither Brooks nor I have adequate answers to the first question. As for the second, one could argue that the efficiency gained from tech companies which makes it possible to never leave your house are worth the costs. Similar arguments could be made for the other domains. Brooks believes that these problems concern our entire society and he might be right but all I know for sure is that n >= 2.
