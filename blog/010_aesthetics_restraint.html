                On the Aesthetic Value of Restraint

                All art is naturally restricted – paintings by the canvas, poems by the page, music by the instrument. You can expand the domain of an art by using a non-traditional medium, e.g. graffiti, but the point is that art is bounded. On one side exists art, on the other non-art (or a different piece of art).

                Artificial restraints can be imposed stricter than the natural restrictions require. The haiku is limited by human convention rather than physical necessity. This restraint can add rather than take away from the value of art; the concision of the haiku keeps the focus on natural scenes rather than language itself. Careful thought must go into shaping art to fit the rules which can lead to insights that might not have been gained otherwise. Of course restraint isn’t always the best recipe for great art. Freedom can allow artists to follow their natural passions and inclinations without the constant worrying that favors conscious judgment over subconscious flow.

                There is a different aspect of restraint concerned with the experience rather than the existence of art: you are either actively experiencing a piece of art or you are not. If you are experiencing art, it can be either positive or negative depending on your taste. If you dislike the art then ceasing to experience it becomes a positive act. However, even if you enjoy the art ceasing to experience it can still be positive. In the passive sense the lack of art can enhance the art when it is finally experienced – hunger is the best sauce as they say. The non-experience of art generates something akin to potential energy which is converted to kinetic energy once the art is experienced again.

                So there is a passive way in which restraint from art can have aesthetic value, but is it possible to turn that absence into an active aesthetic experience? I believe it is possible, at least in some cases. Consider someone with a sweet tooth trying to lose weight. Cutting out dessert would certainly harm their aesthetic life as something would be lost without any gain. Perhaps by limiting their dessert to once a week they could regain some utility, which is indeed what dieters often try to accomplish with “cheat days”, the off days passively increasing the experience of the cheat day. But the decreased frequency of enjoyment outweighs any passive gains from time, ceteris paribus, otherwise there would be no need to institute the policy in the first place. So what is the solution?

                I believe it starts by realizing that the experience is transient. A delicious dessert is satisfying while it is in your mouth and possibly for a short time after, but very quickly disappears. Perhaps a certain satisfaction, or more accurately a lack of desire or hunger, persists for a longer period, but this too is transient. The problem is that while losing weight is undoubtedly a real and valuable goal, it lacks the aesthetics of a good meal. The difference in outcomes of individuals attempting to lose weight arises, in part, from how much aesthetic value they get out of eating. The more pleasure you get from a good meal, the harder it will be for you to excise tasty food from your life.

                What we want is to transform this desire, this hunger, into an aesthetic experience in itself. If we can do that then it would be possible to totally cut out the original art – in this case food. This may seem an impossible task, akin to telling an injured friend that “pain is just in the mind”. In fact it’s worse, you’re injured friend only wants to ignore the pain while I am proposing to flip it into something positive. The difference in these examples is that you have control over the situation. You could end your hunger at any time if you wanted to, but pain is painful, in part, because of a lack of control. This is why in some situations pain can actually be a pleasurable sensation, as in exercise, spicy food, and (as I’ve been told) sex.

                How, specifically, can we convert the restraint of any art into a positive aesthetic experience? I don’t have a formula, but based on the examples above starting slow seems to be important in addition to having control. Anyone who has come back after a break from exercise or tried to eat food well above their spice tolerance level knows that pleasurable pain can turn back into the regular kind quickly. However, once a habit has been established, it becomes easier to appreciate the process itself, to value it intrinsically. This approach could be limited to experiences that are transitory, especially sensory experiences; I’m not sure that other areas of aesthetics could be twisted in such a way.
