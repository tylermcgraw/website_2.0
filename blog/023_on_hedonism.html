                I recently listened to a podcast featuring a moral philosopher who defended hedonistic utilitarianism, the view that one ought to take the action that produces the most net pleasure. This description might conjure up images of Roman patricians lounging on couches being fed grapes by slaves, which is probably why it is so unpopular. This folk hedonism is adopted by some but is not the position the philosopher argued for. She would say that lounging around all day is not real hedonism because it neglects other people’s pleasure and your own long term pleasure. The first point is self-evident: if you spend all of your time pursuing your own pleasure, you necessarily neglect the pleasure of everyone around you. The second point follows from a couple of premises. First, repetitive pleasure becomes less pleasurable over time, an effect known as the “hedonic treadmill”. Second, long term pleasure often comes at the expense of short term pain. Therefore, true hedonists will inevitably pursue long term pleasure because it is (or eventually becomes) the best way to attain pleasure, at the margin.

                This ethical hedonism is starting to look very similar to what most of our moral intuitions say: strike a balance between short and long term pleasure and do good for others. So where does hedonism go wrong? The way I see it, there are two ways to attack hedonism: one can either deny that internal feelings are the only source of morality or show that it leads to absurd conclusions.

                Hedonism seeks to combine the various virtues into a single framework, but one could argue that moderation, knowledge, and other virtues ought to be considered moral ends in themselves, regardless of how much pleasure they produce. We saw earlier how moderation might be seen as good to a hedonist who adopts a view more nuanced than folk hedonism because short and long term pleasures are constantly compared and one does not dominate the other.

                Critic: What about people who do not appreciate knowledge?
                <br>
                Hedonist: We instruct them to do so, because knowledge will allow them to take better actions and thus live a more pleasurable life.
                <br>
                C: Education comes at great expense and often against the will of those being educated. And even if we succeed, isn’t ignorance bliss?
                <br>
                H: No, the right kind of knowledge will make your life more blissful. We shouldn’t teach the kind of knowledge that does not achieve this purpose.
                <br>
                C: What about knowledge that is helpful for others but is painful for you to obtain and use? For example, what if Von Neumann really hated math? Would he be morally obligated to do it anyways, for our benefit? I see the balance between short and long term pleasure, but what about the balance between self and other?
                <br>
                H: &lt;I’m not sure how the hedonist responds. It seems that the calculus suggests one ought to subject oneself to immense pain if it benefits many others. Maybe this is an acceptable result.&gt;
            </p>
            <p>
                Here’s another attempt.
            </p>
            <p>
                C: Say we have two universes, one with me and another with me with twice as much pleasure sensitivity. If we take all the same actions, is the second universe morally better than the first?
                <br>
                H: Yes.
                <br>
                C: Should we place twice as much value on pleasing the second me?
                <br>
                H: Having twice as much sensitivity wouldn’t affect what actions you should perform. However, it would affect the moral calculus of others. 
                <br>
                C: So if I can get myself to feel more pleasure, I can make others more obligated to please me?
                <br>
                H: &lt;Again, the answer is yes, and it is unclear whether or not this is a problem.&gt;
            </p>
            <p>
                The main problem I have with hedonism is that I see pleasure and pain as tools that guide behavior. Children are generally selfish and short-sighted, and must be instructed to think for others and the long term. Hedonists argue that it is in people’s self interest to think for others and the long term. This is perhaps an empirical question, but I don’t believe that this is necessarily true. If people aren’t taught to value others and long term pleasure, they won’t. And if they don’t, then you will maximize their pleasure by giving them all of the short term pleasure that they desire. In short, I see pleasure as descriptive rather than prescriptive.
