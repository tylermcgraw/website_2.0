                I received a signed copy of Tyler Cowen’s 2018 book Stubborn Attachments (thanks Tyler!) after donating to Mercatus Podcasts. Conversations with Tyler is currently my favorite podcast and his and Alex Tabarrok’s blog Marginal Revolution is fantastic, as are the online courses from Marginal Revolution University. I have been putting off reading his books because I consume so much of his other content that I didn’t think it was necessary and of course there are opportunity costs – my Goodreads “to read” list is at 228 and growing. But I figured it would be useful to see his arguments in long form, and so here we are.

                My recreation of the argument:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. The appropriate temporal discount rate is 0%.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Sustainable growth of wealth (broadly defined to include the environment and general well-being) is good.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. There are fundamental human rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conclusion: We should follow common sense morality. Inequality should only be reduced to the extent that it does not interfere with sustainable growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Explanation:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Any discount rate above 0 leads to ridiculous hypotheticals – is it worth killing a billion people in 100 years to prevent an itchy nose today? How about 1000 years? Should we kill a billion people in 2000 years to prevent an itchy nose in 1000 years? Perhaps more salient, should we have prevented an itchy nose 1000 years ago at the cost of a billion lives today? A nerdier attempt: given general relativity, time discounting is really just equivalent to speed discounting. Should we apply discount rates to those who move quickly?

                2. This depends on your view of the future. If you think that humanity is doomed then there is little reason to work hard towards growth – let’s just enjoy what we have while we can. Cowen doesn’t mention this but belief in the opposite extreme, that an inevitable singularity à la Kurzweil is looming ahead of us, leads to a similar conclusion – no need to work hard, just sit back and enjoy watching the future unfold. However, taking a more realistic (in my view) picture of the world where we will last for a few hundred years if we’re not careful and a few billion if we play our cards right leads to the conclusion that sustainable growth is a moral imperative. In the short run growth doesn’t necessarily lead to better living conditions for all, but let the clock run and, as history has shown, everyone wins.

                3. These rights are inviolable for all intents and purposes. If killing a baby would save the human race from extinction then an exception would have to be made, but in real life rights prevail. Why not murder a baby if it would lead to more growth? As ridiculous as it sounds, this was a weak part of the argument. Cowen’s explanation is that there is uncertainty, something something butterfly effect, something chaos theory, therefore we don’t know the long term affect of killing the baby vs not killing the baby. If we kill the baby we would get growth, but perhaps this would lead to Hitler 2.0 being born whom wouldn’t have existed otherwise. The problem is that if we are to believe this argument, how can we ever know if something will lead to sustainable growth rather than end civilization as we know it? Ok, let’s try another argument. Let’s grant that killing the baby would lead to increased growth without any Hitleresque side effects. But if we don’t kill the baby, we would probably catch up to the potential growth anyway, sort of like East Asia. Then again, the catch up growth could be delayed or never occur at all. There doesn’t seem to me to be a clear synthesis between human rights and sustainable growth. But it does seem like a good rule of thumb should be that if you’re going to kill a baby you’d better have a good reason!

            <p>
                Conclusion: Ok, maybe the 0% discount rate isn’t exactly common sense. But for the most part, if you buy what Cowen’s selling, we need not adopt any obviously ridiculous conclusions like we might with some other moral theories. Pursue sustainable growth. Check, we’ve been doing that. Perhaps we should weight the “sustainable” part more, along with including non-economic aspects of growth. But for the most part this is something we already do. And human rights are broader and more guaranteed than at any other point in history. Could we be doing more? Sure. But we seem to be on the right path. An unusual implication of Cowen’s argument is that reducing inequality should take a backseat to promoting sustainable growth. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be doing more to reduce inequality right now per se – we just shouldn’t let that noble pursuit take away from growth which will benefit generations to come. In other words we should remain stubbornly attached to our classic ideals of human rights and growth.
