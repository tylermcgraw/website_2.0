            <h1><em>The Machine Stops</em>, by E.M. Forster</h1>
            <p>2/1/22</p>
            <p>
                <em>The Machine Stops</em> is worth reading solely for the fact that it was written in 1909 and yet accurately predicted so much of our modern life. I can’t think of a more prescient work considering the amount of change that occurred in the over 100 years since it was published. Here are the main ideas the story made me ponder.
            </p>
            <p>
                People are not brought to things, things are brought to people<br>
                In some ways we are trending in this direction – one could point to the rise of Amazon in the world of things and the rise of Zoom in the world of relationships and work. The main difference which hasn’t been borne out is our desire for experiences. Forster’s dystopian society has little regard for anything other than ideas, which I will discuss next. We, on the other hand, love taking vacations and visiting exotic new lands. Perhaps the digital world will take over the experience market, leading to a similar outcome.

                Ideas over experiences<br>
                This is perhaps the only part of Forster’s future I can’t envision. As I mentioned, even as humans become more isolated, we seem to continue to value entertainment and experiences. (Movies, video games, vacations, books) When I think about how an idea-only future could come about it seems possible through significant social and/or genetic engineering. If we decide that we shouldn’t value experiences as much as we currently do it could eventually be possible to shape ourselves into this image. We might want to do this for economic reasons – perhaps travel is expensive or environmentally damaging, or we want people to focus on producing ideas which lead to growth and progress.

                The destruction of space<br>
                As a result of the Machine bringing people everything they could ever need, there is a distinct lack of space. People spend their entire lives in a single room – a bath appears in the morning, a bed at night, a screen to share ideas and talk to others, light, food; there is a switch for everything. In our society it is possible to live in this manner, delivery services will bring you food, the internet will bring you work and social opportunities, Amazon will bring you gizmos, Peloton will bring you exercise. Each of these technologies brings the world closer to us, destroying the physical space which, while at times inconvenient, defines what it means to <em>be</em> in the world. The natural conclusion of this trend seems to me to be neural implants, bypassing the inefficient sensory inputs and muscular outputs that separate the external world from the internal. I am not ideologically for or against any of these technologies but we must acknowledge the unintended consequences they can bring. Being in the world can be inefficient and laborious, but the absurdity of a world bereft of space can lead to dizzying anxiety and dread.

                Globalization and homogenization<br>
                In Forster’s world all of the cities are the same and so there is no point in traveling between them. We are again trending in this direction; as trade, travel, and the internet connect us we are losing languages, art, and customs. Explicit effort can stop this advance but the natural conclusion of a freely connected world is the synthesis of all cultures into one.

                Children raised away from their parents<br>
                This is another example of extrapolating from current trends. Our society has continued to grant individuals rights at the expense of communities and societal norms. Civil rights based on age already exist, so if we grant children individuality the logical conclusion seems to be to liberate them from the oppression of their parents. Why should they eat the food and practice the religion and absorb the politics and be subject to the whims of others? I find it plausible that the state will take over the rearing of children, continuing the trend of expanding the state in the name of liberating individuals

                Worship of the Machine<br>
                Religion is derided in Forster’s world, yet, as David Foster Wallace said, we all worship. For our subterranean citizens this amounts to worship of the Machine, with the Book (a user’s guide to the Machine) as the bible. In our world religion continues to decline and it is unclear to me what is rising to replace it. Sports, money, family, science, and <a href=”https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/soin.12481”>even roller derby</a> have been proclaimed as secular substitutes. The danger is worshiping something as an end that is really just a means to an end. The Machine is a tool to improve the lives of humans, but when it is worshiped in its own right it ceases to do the very thing it was meant for. The same could be said for most of the things we worship today – once they become objects of worship sports stop being entertaining, money stops buying a better life, and science stops producing knowledge. Perhaps this is the wisdom of the ancients, what, other than religion, can be worshiped without creating negative consequences?
