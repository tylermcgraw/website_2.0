                A few months ago I found myself at a Shabbat dinner with my friend and some members of his family. As the dinner came to an end we went around the table and began to name things we were grateful for. Our conversation naturally shifted to acknowledging our fortunate situation, and from there to philanthropy and what we could do to make a positive impact on the world.

                My friend's cousin, also a recent college graduate, expressed that he wanted to save his money and allow it to compound so that he could make a larger impact later in his life. I acknowledged that there were definitely benefits to waiting, for example if you wanted to start a foundation or organization that requires a large amount of initial capital. However, I pushed back a bit by arguing that money isn't the only thing that compounds with time. Let's say you waited until you retired to make your big donation. If you spend $4,000 today, you can buy enough malaria medicine to save one life. (See GiveWell's top charities) If you save that $4,000, under ideal conditions (guaranteed 10% interest yearly) you'll have ~$200,000 after 40 years. One argument is that you'll be able to save 50x more lives by waiting 40 years, so you should obviously wait. My rebuttal is that while your money is compounding, so is the opportunity cost of your donation. By not donating, in the short term you deprive one family of a loved one. (Probably a child) But over time, you deprive a country of a contributing member of their society and economy. Your $4k turned into $200k, but how much money would that child have generated over their lifetime? How much would they have contributed to their family, their church, their local community? The second question is hard to quantify and given how low yearly incomes are in many of the countries where it is easiest to save a life the answer to the first question could turn out to be <$200k.

                To reiterate, I think that there are cases where it makes sense to save your money before donating. My point was simply not to underestimate the impact you can have now, and the compounding change you can affect. If I wanted to make a stronger argument against waiting to donate, I could point out that
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Your values are going to change over time, and there's no guarantee that you won't turn into an Ebenezer Scrooge in your golden years.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is no guarantee that your money will compound indefinitely, as in the ideal example I presumed. The past is not a perfect predicter of the future, and may underrate "black swan" events, to use Nassim Taleb's terminology.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Saying "I'll donate more later" sounds suspiciously like "I'll go to the gym later". Sure, if you wait you might be able to do more research about what exercises are best, what foods you should avoid, and what supplements you should take, but every day you wait is a day you're not doing the one thing you set out to do: go to the gym.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not confident enough to make that stronger argument but it's something I've been thinking about. On the flip side, there are obviously other reasons for saving your money than to make a large donation. My thinking comes from a place of privilege and I wouldn't want to guilt anyone who doesn't have any savings into donating all of their money instead of saving and investing it.
