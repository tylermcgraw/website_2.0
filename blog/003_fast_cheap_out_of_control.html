            <h1>Errol Morris' <em>Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control</em></h1>
            <p>10/13/21</p>

                <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119107/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1"><em>Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control</em></a> is a documentary about a lion trainer, a topiary gardener, a naked mole-rat specialist, and a robot scientist, but it spoke to me on larger topics such as purpose, control, and being in the world. I found it to be a pleasurable viewing experience and unmistakably "Morrisian". This is not a review but rather an attempt to collect my thoughts and deposit them in one place.

                The film features the interrotron, Morris' invention that allows subjects to look him in the eyes while also looking directly into the camera. He interleaves his interviews with grainy WWII footage, old black and white cartoons and movies, and off kilter shots of his subjects' domains. I rather liked the aesthetic and thought the scoring was great, adding depth in the right places.

                The focus of the documentary is on the four subjects. George has devoted his life to trimming shrubs into the shape of various animals, aka topiary. It doesn't take long for you to ask yourself "why?" as you listen to George describe his life's work - "it's just cut and wait, cut and wait" he says. One doesn't get the sense that he particularly enjoys the work itself - his favorite animal is the bear because it only requires two trimmings per year. It's also not about building a legacy - George doesn't have any understudies and freely acknowledges that the garden will cease to exist after his death. So why spend so much effort maintaining it?

                Rodney, the roboticist, says, "if you analyze it too much, life becomes almost meaningless". There certainly seems to be a gap left by the retreat of the divine in our society. Rather than face the question of meaning in a world without God, we distract ourselves with work and entertainment. But if we avoid the question, how can we possibly find an answer?

                Enter Roy, the mole-rat specialist. He recalls how he was always interested in entomology as a kid but the conventional view that mammals couldn't build societies like ants or termites rubbed him the wrong way. Then one night a friend called him and said, "'Ray, they found them.' [Ray] knew exactly what he was talking about and said 'where?'" Throughout the film there is a Romantic sense that Roy and the other subjects are fulfilling their intrinsic nature. There is never a question of whether they're on the right path, despite how weird, obscure, and even meaningless their work seems from the outside.

                But there is also a contradictory notion of unnatural control. According to Roy, in nature "you're either prey, you're an enemy, or you're ignored." The relationship between the subjects and the objects of their respective careers do not seem to fit into any of these categories. Roy's fascination with mole-rats eventually leads him to build a mole-rat exhibit at a zoo. Dave, the lion trainer, relies on all manners of trickery to get his lions to perform various feats. George molds plants into recognizable forms. They are all exhibiting control over nature, yet there is the sense that there is no natural reason. They aren't consuming the plants/animals, nor are they treating them as an enemy. "I don't tell the robot what to do, I turn it on and it does what's in it's nature" says Rodney. And yet without a human to program it, the robot does nothing. Morris too composes his subjects just as they compose their animals, shrubs, and robots. Is this control central to our being? Is it human nature to achieve the unnatural?

                Morris doesn't answer any of these questions, and I don't even know how many of them he intended to ask in the first place. That is part of the beauty of the film - that somehow briefly peaking into the lives of four quirky individuals could somehow reveal deep philosophical questions about life itself. I don't often rewatch films but I see myself coming back to <em>Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control</em> in the future.
