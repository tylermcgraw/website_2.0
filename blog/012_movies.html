<h1>Movies of Late 2021</h1>

    <h2>The Good: <em>The French Dispatch</em></h2>
    A Wes Anderson film featuring Timothee Chalamet, what more could you want? Anderson’s inimitable style is on full display here as he investigates art, revolution, and expatriation in 3 vignettes linked by journalism and ennui. Cameos from Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, and Zero (from <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em>) add to the fun.

    <h2>The Bad: <em>Matrix: Resurrections</em></h2>
    The story in the new matrix is interesting but the film starts to fall apart when it shifts to the real world, as it did in the trilogy. I’m left with many questions – didn’t the trilogy end with Neo sacrificing himself to save humanity and kill Smith for the machines? Wouldn’t humanity get wiped out now that Neo is returned? Why is Smith still here? Why is Hugo Weaving not here? What about the billions of humans still in the matrix? I wanted answers but all I got were flashbacks and flat action scenes.

    <h2>The Ugly: <em>Cowboy Bepop</em> (Live Action)</h2>
    I obviously really wanted to like the live action version of an anime classic, but it’s just… not good. Everything about it seems fake, from the acting to Jet’s beard to the cinematography. The sets and music are solid, though.

<h2>Others:</h2>

    <h3><em>Don’t Look Up</em></h3>
    What happens to the truth when everything becomes a narrative? In <em>Don’t Look Up</em>, it kills everyone.  I’m sure the reaction on the left is to say “trust the science” while the reaction on the right is to rip the film for its liberal leanings. Of course, one of these reactions is worse than the other, though they are both wrong. “Trust the science” is itself a narrative, as the film shows through Dicaprio’s reluctant support of the regime (Anthony Fauci, anyone?). And the only indication that the President’s regime is right wing are the red caps of her supporters, but no matter what color hat you wear politicians and the media will continue to lie when it benefits them. The film doesn’t give a clear solution in my view. Perhaps one could view President Xi’s call alerting the President that the asteroid is still intact at the end of the film as a vote of confidence in the Chinese system. They seem willing to lie whenever it benefits their regime, but maybe when it comes to existential risk authoritarianism is the answer? I don’t buy it, but it seems plausible that decentralization has contributed to the rise in conspiracy theories and division.

    <h3><em>The Sopranos</em> Season 1</h3>
    The more you put in, the more you get out of this one. Like <em>The Wire</em>, but focused on a man instead of a city.
</p>
<p>
    <h3><em>Squid Game</em></h3>
    I watched the first 5 episodes over a month ago and haven’t finished. It’s not bad but also not as compelling as everyone else thinks - I have found better uses of my time since.

<p>
    <h3><em>An Altogether Forgettable Film</em> ft. Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and Gal Gadot.</h3>
    The Rock and Reynolds are entertaining as usual, but the film offers nothing special. It is what it is – inoffensive Netflix filler. Gadot is a great Wonder Woman but is bland and poorly cast here.
</p>
<p>
    <h3><em>A Quiet Place Part II</em></h3>
    The short prequel with Krasinski was the best part, the rest of the film was not particularly compelling. The concept behind the series remains interesting, hopefully part III is more ambitious.
