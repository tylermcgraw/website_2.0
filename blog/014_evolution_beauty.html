            <h1><em>The Evolution of Beauty</em>, by Richard O. Prum</h1>
            <p>1/25/22</p>
            <p>
                <em>The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin’s Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World – and Us</em> is a book about birds, beauty, and evolution. Harvard ornithologist Richard Prum also tries to bridge his commanding knowledge of birds to the realm of people but is at his best when talking about his true love: birds. I give a rundown of his thesis, questions I have, and some predictions and takeaways.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is a bird’s-eye view of the argument:<br>
                Most people (biologists included) think that all of evolution can be explained by natural selection. It is from the <em>Origin of Species</em> that we get the classic example of Darwin’s finches which speciated based on their specific food sources. The simple explanation is that finches in different locations evolved beaks to have different shapes and sizes based on the type of food available. However, it is much harder to come up with an explanation for why there is so much beauty in nature. Darwin famously said that “the sight of a peacock’s tail makes me sick.” How do we reckon with all this natural beauty? Darwin himself came up with a solution, neglected for much of history, in his lesser known book <em>The Descent of Man</em>: evolution by sexual selection.

            <p>
                The explanation is simple – females (and in a few species, males) choose their mates based on what they find attractive. Mate choice is necessary here; without the ability to choose females would not be able to select for the traits they want. If females value beauty in their mates, then beauty shall arise. At this point skeptics will point out that mate choice alone does not prove that sexual selection exists, for it could just be that the traits females find attractive are all based on “fitness”. That is, beauty is not being selected for its intrinsic value but for signaling “good genes” or a cost that the male bird has overcome. After all, flying around with a bright target on your back seems like a pretty bad idea – surely there must be a counteracting force preventing beauty from succumbing to its great evolutionary costs. Prum dispenses with these notions, pointing out that the genes required to grow a pretty feather have nothing to do with survival and that while male birds with bright feathers do overcome a cost, on net there is no benefit. Think about it – a bird with bright feathers must have great physical prowess to overcome this hurdle, but when you subtract the cost of the hurdle there is no benefit! The much simpler explanation is that females like beauty. Males who evolve to be beautiful are more “fit” than their peers not because of natural selection but because they are more attractive to females.

                If you are not convinced by this I suggest reading the book. But assuming it is correct there is still the question of how beauty first arose. It makes sense why beauty persists now that females prefer it, but how did this preference come about? To answer this question Prum turns to Ronald Fisher (yes, the same Fisher from AP Stats). Fisher proposed a two stage model: first, females develop a preference for traits that are purely indicative of physical capability; second, the trait becomes an end in itself, leading to “runaway” sexual selection. For example, females of a bird species develop a preference for long tails because they indicate greater flight ability and survival. Long tails would already have been evolutionarily advantageous for males due to natural selection, but become even more so once sexual selection begins to take place. Because both natural and sexual selection are acting on tail length, an equilibrium is reached that differs from what natural selection would reach on its own. Thus, tails can become so long that they hurt survival yet persist because they enhance reproductive capability.

                Prum spends much of the book talking about birds, which I quite enjoyed, but also has ambitions for applying sexual selection to humans. Despite not having the beautiful ornamentation of our feathered friends, we seem to have some traits that persist for predominantly aesthetic reasons. Some examples: hair (why we lost most, but not all, of it in specific locations), the penis (why it is so big and boneless with respect to other primates), and social traits. Prum is not as convincing in these chapters, unsurprisingly given his background in ornithology, but gives plausible accounts that require more investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main question I have is why birds are so much more beautiful than any other group of animals. Prum points to mate choice – males compete intensely with each other for the approval of females rather than mere access to them. I haven’t seen this term used but I imagine birds having a beauty hierarchy as opposed to a dominance (or, as in humans, a prestige) hierarchy. And not only are they beautiful, 95% of bird species lack male penises. Ducks are an exception, and in them we see both female driven sexual selection based on aesthetics and male driven forced copulation enabled by the duck penis. Prum’s explanation for why some birds have penises and other don’t is again mate choice – females prefer males without penises because this frees them from sexual coercion.
            </p>
            <p>
                But why are some species able to display more mate choice than others? I feel like this is a key question that Prum could have addressed in more detail. In the chapter on duck penises he mentions in passing several ecological factors that contribute to males with smaller penises and females with simpler vaginas (female ducks have a clockwise corkscrewing vagina as a defense against males’ counter clockwise penis): lower densities of breeding individuals, exclusive territoriality, and reduced social opportunity for male sexual coercion. So if I try to piece the picture together, I imagine that 63 million years ago the predecessor to the Neoaves had females with enough discretion to drive the devolution of the male penis. With the penis gone, all female Neoaves (95% of birds) have enough power to continue to select for males with the characteristics they desire.

            <p>
                Predictions:<br>
                Once devolved, a penis will not reemerge.<br>
                This is different from saying that penises cannot evolve in the first place. The reason is that the devolution of a penis involves a significant amount of female mate choice, and once the penis is gone males lack the leverage to coerce females. Females prefer males without penises because it affords them more power over their mating choices, and so the penis will not reemerge. The fact that not a single descendant of the Neoaves has re-evolved a penis is evidence for this claim.
            </p>
            <p>
                Corollary:<br>
                The human penis will not devolve.<br>
                Given the previous prediction and the fact that we live in an egalitarian society, one might expect the human penis to eventually devolve as females prefer small penises to reduce the chance of sexual coercion, but there are aesthetic reasons for its presence.

                Takeaways:<br>
                
                Birds are beautiful in complex ways (as are humans, to a lesser extent).<br>
                
                Female mate choice, or sexual selection, drives evolution along with natural selection.<br>
                
                So birds and humans are beautiful because of females’ ability to choose.<br>
                
                Humans are unique for our cultural capacity, not our aesthetic appreciation.<br>
