<h1><em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, The Epic of Gilgamesh,</em> and <em>Range</em></h1>

<h2><em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em></h2>
<p>
    A classic children's story that everyone can take something from. From clever word play to existential thoughts on the self to the construction of meaning from language, Carroll's dream sequence is mesmerizing and I'm glad I finally got around to giving it a read. I vaguely remember watching the animated Disney version as a kid and thinking it was a bit creepy which could explain why I avoided it until now.

<h2><em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em></h2>
<p>
    I was amazed at how much of this story was familiar. I'm not religious and have never read the Bible but parts of Gilgamesh seemed to me to be an exact replica. A flood wiping out humanity except for a chosen one who was told to build a boat? An evil serpent and a forbidden fruit?? Not to mention the general story being a standard hero's journey despite being over 4,000 years old. It was also interesting to see the excessive repetition, presumably because the story was originally passed down orally.

<h2><em>Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World</em></h2>
<p>
    The first thing I thought when I saw the cover of Epstein's latest work was "huh, apparently Malcolm Gladwell 'loved Range'." The second thing I thought was "wait, didn't he write a book with the exact opposite thesis?" While <em>Outliers</em> wasn't the polar opposite to <em>Range</em>, it did cause the "10,000 hour rule" to permeate our cultural consciousness. There seems to be a tension between the specialization required of putting in 10,000 hours of work and the generalization promoted in <em>Range</em>. If you read the texts it's possible to come out with a nuanced view that is compatible with both, but this is one of my problems with popular science books. They often have snappy titles and seemingly bold claims but the thesis turns out to be a watered-down version of the implied thesis. It reminds me of the motte-and-bailey fallacy:
</p>
<blockquote>
    A Motte and Bailey castle is a medieval system of defence in which a stone tower on a mound (the Motte) is surrounded by an area of land (the Bailey) which in turn is encompassed by some sort of a barrier such as a ditch. Being dark and dank, the Motte is not a habitation of choice. The only reason for its existence is the desirability of the Bailey, which the combination of the Motte and ditch makes relatively easy to retain despite attack by marauders. When only lightly pressed, the ditch makes small numbers of attackers easy to defeat as they struggle across it: when heavily pressed the ditch is not defensible and so neither is the Bailey. Rather one retreats to the insalubrious but defensible, perhaps impregnable, Motte. Eventually the marauders give up, when one is well placed to reoccupy desirable land. ... the Bailey, represents a philosophical doctrine or position with similar properties: desirable to its proponent but only lightly defensible. The Motte is the defensible but undesired position to which one retreats when hard pressed.<br>
    - Wikipedia quoting Nicholas Shackel, who prefers the term motte-and-bailey <em>doctrine</em> but I think people like being able to accuse others of having committed a fallacy so that's what's popularly used.
</blockquote>

    "10,000 hours" and "Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World" are the rewarding but not defensible Bailey while the nuanced argument is the Motte. Publishers likely carry more of the blame than the authors in creating this divide, but nonetheless I get very suspicious whenever I come across the genre. Fortunately, <em>Range</em> gave a convincing argument contra Tiger Woods-esque hyperspecialization. There were more anecdotes than empirical data but I found it to be convincing. I also found it interesting that in Smith's <em>Wealth of Nations</em>, which I am currently reading, one of the reasons that the division of labor gives rise to greater production is increased innovation. This, like the 10,000 hour rule, seems to be at odds with Epstein's claim that hyperspecialization decreases innovation and problem-solving ability. I think the solution is to acknowledge that specialization is good and necessary but to caution against focusing on one thing so closely that you blind yourself to other possibilities.
