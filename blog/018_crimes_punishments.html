            <h1><em>On Crimes and Punishments</em>, by Cesare Beccaria</h1>

            <p>
                Notes and interesting bits from Cesare Beccaria's essay on crimes and their punishments. Many of his arguments are or could be used today, such as his cases against capital punishment and banning arms. Aside from some Straussian moments (see chapter 39) Beccaria is quite lucid and readable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Introduction: laws are not changed by masses shifting their views (culture), laws are made by a few elites which then changes culture
            </p>
            <p>
                1. "Of the Origin of Punishments": Sovereign consists of the sum of liberties given up by citizens.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. "Of the Interpretation of the laws": Against the "spirit of the law" (magistrates who interpret laws - "this will depend on [the judge's] digestion", among other trifling things), "tyrants never read"
            </p>
            <p>
                5. "Of the Obscurity of Laws": Against obscure laws which lead to interpretation of laws and a class of interpreters
            </p>
            <p>
                6. "Of the Proportion between Crimes and Punishments": If you punish different crimes in identical ways there is no deterrence against committing the worse crime.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. "Of estimating the Degree of Crimes": Degree of crime is based on harm to society rather than sin, intent, dignity of offendee
            </p>
            <p>
                9. "Of Honor": Honor codes often differ from the law, yet we can't even define honor. Honor is a return to a state of nature and "original equality"
            </p>
            <p>
                16. "Of Torture": The accused is either guilty or innocent, torture is inappropriate in both cases. People say anything to stop the torture
            </p>
            <p>
                19. "Of the Advantage of immediate Punishment": Punishment should follow crime asap to establish causation and reduce uncertainty, punishment should match crime and be public if possible to deter potential criminals.
            </p>
            <p>
                24. "Of Idleness": Idleness (those who contribute neither labor nor riches) should be punished - inheriting wealth is fine as long as you help the poor.
            </p>
            <p>
                26. "Of the Spirit of Family in States": Laws should pertain to men (individuals) not families. Laws for families result in slavery for everyone other than the father. The bigger the society the smaller part each individual plays, and "an overgrown republic can only be saved from despotism, by subdividing it into a number of confederate republics." How? With a dictator! If he is ambitious he will be immortal, if a philosopher his citizens will thank him. (I assume the implication is that only the philosopher would willingly give up power to form a confederacy)
            </p>
            <p>
                28. "Of the Punishment of Death": Suicide and murder can't both be illegal; if laws are formed from the smallest liberty individuals are willing to part with and death is a legal punishment, that implies that killing oneself is a right. Knows his position is unpopular among the commoners, hopes that other philosophers will agree with him and influence princes to change their laws.
            </p>
            <p>
                32. "Of Suicide": Punishment of suicide can only be wraught upon the innocent and the dead.
            </p>
            <p>
                36. "Of Rewards for Apprehending, or Killing Criminals": Against rewards for citizens (for apprehending or killing criminals) because they encourage what would normally be considered crime.
            </p>
            <p>
                38. "Of Suggestive Interrogations": Why are suggestive interrogations (that directly ask about the crime) illegal but torture legal? What is more suggestive than pain?
            </p>
            <p>
                39. "Of a Particular Kind of Crimes": A bit Straussian, no? "But men of understanding will perceive, that the age and country in which I live will not permit me to inquire into the nature of this crime." Clearly referring to crimes and punishments of a religious nature. I think he personally believes that it is wrong for countries to force (religious) opinions on their subjects. He says that it is necessary for rulers to forcefully unify views, but says that he doesn't have the time to explain why. He also says that their are countries which don't do this and that it would lead to dissimulation followed by contempt, which I read as revealing his true feelings on the subject. Voltaire's translation makes this reading clearer than Richard Davies', which makes sense given Voltaire's own esoteric leanings. ("There are truths which are not for all men, nor for all times.")
            </p>
            <p>
                40. "Of False Ideas of Utility": Banning arms only disarms the innocent.
            </p>
            <p>
                41. "Of the Means of Preventing Crimes": The fear of the laws is salutary, but the fear of men is a fruitful and fatal source of crimes."
            </p>
            <p>
                42. "Of the Sciences": Knowledge reduces crime, though knowledge in small doses can be dangerous. Ignorance was necessary to unite men with differing passions in their state of nature. Says that he isn't speaking of God (which I do not believe. See 39, as well as his letter to D'Alembert). Knowledge of truth by the many leads to upheaval
            </p>
            <p>
                43 - 45. "Of Magistrates", "Of Rewards", "Of Education": Respect of laws over magistrates, rewarding virtue, and education reduce crime.
            </p>
            <p>
                47. "Conclusion": Severity of punishments should be proportional to the state of the nation. Newer states need harsher punishments.
                "That a punishment may not be an act of violence, of one or of many, against a private member of society, it should be public, immediate and necessary; the least possible in the case given; proportional to the crime, and determined by the laws."
