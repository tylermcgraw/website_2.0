    I’ve only rated 21 films since starting to use IMDb’s watchlist and rating system, and Rashomon is the first one I’ve given a 10. Akira Kurosawa’s reputation precedes him so I knew it would be a beautiful masterpiece going in, but what pushed this film to the next level for me was the striking moral message it delivered.
</p>
<p>
    Rashomon tells the story of a horrific crime from 4 different individuals. The perspectives are shared in a linear fashion, so it was not until the second individual’s recounting that I realized that they are unreliable narrators. My instinct was to try to reconcile the two tellings – given the facts, the differences in their stories, and their motivations, perhaps it would be possible to reconstruct what really happened. I thought I had made some progress, but then the third account came in and complicated things, and by the fourth I had given up. Perhaps this was one of the intended effects of the film – to frustrate those who would try to construct an objective reality. As the film continued I found myself feeling contempt for each of the tellers. They were all clearly manipulating the crime for their own egoistic benefit, the victims of the crime to an even greater extent than the perpetrator. The linear arrangement of narratives lead me to turn my critique inwards: once you hear 4 stories full of lies and evil you cannot help but think about how you tell the same lies to yourself and others every day.

    We all lie, we all have egoistic drives we prop up; we all sin. Where is our redemption? Kurosawa offers us an answer: in raising the next generation. The world keeps spinning, the cycle of life and death continues; all we can do, and all we must do, is try to make things better for our descendants. Other analyses I have read either disregard the moral element entirely or interpret it more generally than I. They say the answer is that just as we all lie, we all have the capacity for good. The ending is just a particular instance of this. I don’t think it really matters what Kurosawa intended or even what the specific answer is. But what is non-negotiable in my view is the fact that Rashomon identifies a flaw in humans and offers us a way out – it is deeply moral.

    I’m no film expert, but it is puzzling to me that not a single critic (as listed on IMDb) picked up on this. To them, the film was about the subjective nature of truth – which would be like saying that 12 Angry Men was about legal injustice. Like, yes, technically, but you missed the boat – at least in my opinion. The A.V. Club says that is is about the difficulty of finding truth. Sure, ok. The Guardian says that it is about the nature of human communication. Huh? Roger Ebert says that “The message of Rashomon is that we should suspect even what we think we have seen.” Warmer. If you go from thinking about truth to thinking about how you lie, you’re headed in the right direction. And yet the final leap – to morality, what one ought to do with this knowledge – is left unleapt. I even came across and MIT professor of film who, at the conclusion of his hour long lecture on Rashomon, claimed that the film was tarnished by its moralistic ending, and that Kurosawa let his humanistic tendencies ruin his art.

    I could not disagree more with these interpretations. There is no doubt that the subjective nature of truth is a part of the film, but to claim that this is the point of the film is to water down its message. Does not every college freshman write some variation on this theme? It’s not like Kurosawa came up with the idea of unreliable eyewitnesses in 1950, despite the so-called “Rashomon effect” which implies such. Yes, it is a beautifully crafted film, but is that really what gave it so much acclaim?
</p>
<p>
    Again, I am no insider in the art or film worlds, but it seems that the critic’s answer is yes. Films are not supposed to have moral messages; art should be pure, untouched by such terrestrial concerns. In a postmodern setting where not only truth but morality is subjective, it is gauche to speak in moral absolutes. Questions of how one ought to live belong to religion, to government – to the man. Art belongs to counterculture. Thus speaks the modern art world.
