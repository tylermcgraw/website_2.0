            <h1><em>Either/Or</em> by Søren Kierkegaard</h1>
            <p>3/7/22</p>
            <p>
                <em>Either/Or</em>, by Søren Kierkegaard and translated by Alastair Hannay, is the kind of book you read twice, carefully and deliberately, or not at all. Given the length of the work I suspect that all but the most ambitious or stubborn of readers choose the latter. As Hannay notes in his introduction, the first either/or Kierkegaard presents is an implicit one: “Must I really read the whole thing?” The question seems to have been answered in the negative for many given the wide gulf in sales between <em>Either</em>, the first part of the original two-volume work, and <em>Or</em>, the second. Regarding this state of affairs I am of the same opinion as Kierkegaard himself, “If someone starts by saying ‘either’ – and doesn’t conceal from the listener that the first clause is going to be a very long one, you owe it to him either to ask him not to begin or to listen also to his ‘or’.” I submitted myself to both his ‘either’ and his ‘or’ because of his reputation as the father of existentialism and the consensus that <em>Either/Or</em> is his magnum opus, and because I had the sense that he was writing to answer a question that I myself was asking:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                “What I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose, to see what it really is that God wills that I shall do; the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.” - Journal entry, 1835
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                In this context Kierkegaard’s ‘either’ is to live in a purely aesthetic manner, as exemplified in part one, while his ‘or’ is to live ethically, as per part two. Based on what I know of him Kierkegaard followed neither doctrine, calling off his marriage to Regine Olsen and retreating inward prior to writing <em>Either/Or</em>. This may partially explain his choice to use two unknown authors, called ‘A’ and ‘B’, to champion the conflicting viewpoints. He further separates himself by introducing an editor named Victor Eremita (victorious hermit) who has stumbled upon the essays and letters of A and B. Kierkegaard was cloistered following his breakup so hermit makes sense, but victorious – against whom? The philosopher Georg Hegel is one answer. Hegel’s view, which I have only read second and third hand so take with a grain of salt, is that reality is the mediation of opposing historical forces. The classic breakdown is that you start with a thesis, which is opposed by its opposite, the antithesis. The mediation between these two results in a final synthesis, which becomes the new thesis. This so-called Hegelian dialectic has an inevitable quality, that every viewpoint can and will be cohesively synthesized, which Kierkegaard believed would lead to spiritlessness and passivity. This leads to yet another interpretation of <em>Either/Or</em> as a tool against philosophy itself, as Hegelianism was dominant at the time. This may help explain why <em>Either/Or</em> was structured in such an unusual manner. Kierkegaard stepped outside the bounds of philosophy by conveying his views through pseudonyms and collections of essays and letters to create a more effective attack vector.

                Victor Eremita begins the preface by doubting the Hegelian view that the inward is the outward and the outward is the inward, and that one of A and B exemplifies this more than the other. Which one is it? If we take Johannes to really be A, then while A both thinks and lives purely aesthetically, there is a deceptive nature about him – he doesn’t allow his inner nature to be revealed to the world. On the other hand, B, judge Vilhelm, defends the ethical view and seems to practice what he preaches – married, family man, gainfully employed. Yet there is a sense that his inner world is not as committed to the ethical view. Both of his essays do not defend the ethical view on its own, but rather try to show how one can still find aesthetic pleasure living an ethical life. For B the inner is not the outer while for A the outer is not the inner.

                We begin to get a sense of A’s philosophy early in <em>Diapsalmata</em>. "Let others complain that our age is evil; my complaint is that it is paltry. For it is without passion… Their desires are stodgy and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these hucksters, but like the Jews, they let themselves clip the coin just a little". A views the people of his age as hypocrites – they live, or at least try to appear to live, ethically but aren’t fully committed, they “clip the coin” and enjoy “stodgy and sluggish” pleasures. The implications seems to be that it’s better to embrace sin and live to the fullest. Why clip the coin when you could steal it instead? A similar thought is expressed in the “fire of life” metaphor later in the chapter. A compares businessmen who devote their life to work to a housewife who saves fire-tongs from a house fire. The implication is that duty (to marriage, work, etc) is merely a means to an end, not an end in itself as the ethicist views it. However, A’s aesthetic view seems just as illogical; if he believes that anything can be saved from the fire, why not save something lasting like family or religion? A is like a child who is eating candy and playing with toys while the house burns around him. If anything this metaphor could lend support to the religious view of life over both the ethical and aesthetic, but Kierkegaard doesn’t write about the religion as a distinctive life stage in <em>Either/Or</em>. So what does the aesthetic view entail? Wikipedia says that it is hedonistic but that is not the way I read it. A says that while wine may be more enjoyable than water, when one wants water it becomes more appealing. Later he claims that “Pleasure disappoints, not possibility.” Hedonism only satisfies pleasure, but A’s aesthetic is more complex. Later in <em>The Seducer’s Diary</em> Johannes, a character one suspects is a pseudonym of A (adding yet another layer of obscurity), says that “One has to restrict oneself, that is the main condition of all enjoyment.” The aesthetic is more than hedonism, there is a restraint and complexity far beyond simply valuing any and all pleasure. What makes something aesthetic is elaborated in A’s longer essays.

                A begins <em>The Immediate Erotic Stages or the Musical Erotic</em> by claiming that Mozart’s <em>Don Giovanni</em> is a classic without comparison because 1. abstract art is harder to replicate than concrete, 2. music is an abstract art (though not as abstract as architecture), 3. sensuality is the most abstract idea, and can only be effectively conveyed through music. So, A says, each generation will have it’s Faust (since language is concrete), there will be only a few classic sculptures (though abstract, they cannot capture sensuality), and only one <em>Don Giovanni</em>. He then discusses the stages and significance of the musical erotic. The first stage is that of sensual awakening, where desire is still asleep. In the second desire awakens and seeks its object. The third stage is the active desiring of the object, as depicted by <em>Don Giovanni</em>. The first stage is contradictory because the object of desire cannot be acquired. The second stage is contradictory because the desire has yet to be specified, discovery of the true object must take place before it can be captured. In the third stage desire has its particular object. It is important to distinguish seduction from other forms of the erotic, for Don Juan’s seduction is never about the individual he desires but about sensuality for its own sake. Faust makes sense in a literary medium because it is about the demonic spiritual, which can be expressed in an individual. Don Juan is about the demonic sensual, but he is not so much an individual as the reflection of sensual energy. This is why music must be the medium for <em>Don Giovanni</em>, the vibrations express this hovering between individual and idea.

                <em>Ancient Tragedy’s Reflection in the Modern</em> argues that the difference between ancient and modern tragedies is in how the tragic element is formed. In the ancient model “the main thing is the <em>telos</em>”, or end goal/purpose, which is informed by the state, family, and destiny. The tragedy comes from the contradiction between an individual’s duties to these respective categories. The modern model consists solely of the actions of an individual in a situation, so that he is either entirely guilty or not guilty at all. “Hence modern tragedy has no epic foreground, no epic heritage. The hero stands and falls entirely of his own deeds.” Thus the ancient depiction of Antigone buries her brother out of “fateful necessity” rather than free will. A connects this to the idea of the aesthetic versus the ethical by saying that the modern tragic hero becomes evil and sinful, which are ethical considerations. The ambiguous guilt of the ancient tragedy is aesthetic because even if the hero has individuality, there is a fatalistic aspect due to the various traditions in their society.

                The aim of <em>Shadowgraphs</em> (images formed by the shadow of an object on a surface) was an exploration of the aesthetic value of sorrow. A touched on the topic in the previous essay, explaining that sorrow is deeper than pain because it exists in the cultural consciousness. We can see from the name of the essay that A also sees sorrow as illuminating the inner to the outer. He uses Donna Elvira, from Mozart’s <em>Don Giovanni</em>, to demonstrate this: “Her sorrow courses through her with a single beat of the pulse, and it flows outwardly, the passion shines through her in a blaze and can be seen in her outward appearance. Hate, despair, vengeance, love, all break forth to make themselves visibly revealed. At this moment she is picturesque.” Most people are not shadowgraphs – when you illuminate them all you see is their outer appearance. Donna Elvira on the other hand, due to her sorrow, is seen for all her inner passions and emotions. My immediate reaction was to disagree that sorrow is the only way to see how someone really feels, psychological/anthropological research has shown that there are 7 basic emotions that are universally recognized, even in tribes isolated from the rest of the world. Sadness is one of them, but if you show someone a picture of a smiling face they understand the meaning of that emotion everywhere you go. However, perhaps innateness is not the only thing to take into consideration. As Tolstoy said, “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Whether this is true of individuals I don’t know, but I think we start to see another aspect of the aesthetic here. There is a sense that the aesthetic is both universal, as sorrow is or can be felt by anyone, and particular, as it reveals something unique and hidden about an individual.

                <em>The Unhappiest One</em>, as the name suggests, seeks to find the unhappiest person in history. A believes that unhappy people are never present with themselves, and thus always live in the past (remembering) or the future (hoping). He distinguishes between memories and hopes that have reality and those that don’t. A memory of something that actually happened to you has reality whereas a memory of something that you wished had happened lacks reality, the latter being more painful than the former. And since the past is always moving further from the present while the future moves closer the unhappiest one is among the rememberers. Thus the true unhappiest one would be an unreal rememberer, one who is consumed by nostalgia for a past that never was. At least the real rememberer can find solace in the fact that at one time the good old days of the past were the present. The unreal rememberer must confront the fact that not only is the past slipping away, but so is the hope that accompanies it.

                In <em>Crop Rotation</em> A laments that boredom is the root of all evil, and must be placated by what he calls “crop rotation”. Instead of changing the metaphorical soil by visiting new places or acquiring new things, A says that you should instead change the crops by limiting yourself, remembering and forgetting, avoiding friendship, marriage, and vocational responsibility, and constantly changing yourself. Put another way, he supports intensive rather than extensive change. He says prisoners and students (redundant, no?) are forced to be creative and appreciate the little things. He sees life as the ebbing and flowing of remembering and forgetting. It is good to forget painful things, and remembering is useful when you are getting used to enjoyment and start getting bored or unappreciative. Avoiding friendship does not mean avoiding human contact, it just means moving apart. This may be unpleasant but “unpleasantness is a piquant ingredient in the contrariety of life.” One should avoid marriage for a similar reason, though marriage also kills freedom and can never be as good as imagined. Vocational titles transform people into cogs in the machine and strip them of their individuality, but the solution is  to promote not idleness but “breadless skills”. He does not specify what would qualify as such but I am reminded of Teddy Roosevelt’s “non-remunerative work” and Zhuangzi’s “usefulness of uselessness”. Roosevelt disdained the idle children of the upper class but placed great value on work that contributed to humanity despite not being well compensated. For him this included art, science, exploration, and history. Zhuangzi saw great value in uselessness – an example he used was a great tree with twisted branches and a gnarled trunk. Cinnamon trees are cut down for spice, varnish trees are hacked for their sap, but ugly, useless trees are left untouched and can grow as large as they please.

                <em>The Seducer’s Diary</em> is the longest and most famous section of the book. In it Johannes (whose diary was discovered by A, whose escritoire was purchased by Victor Eremita, who is the pseudonym of Kierkegaard, for those keeping track) describes his seduction of a young woman, Cordelia, over the course of some months.  We get a sense of his pleasure at spontaneous, or at least seemingly spontaneous, circumstances that bring him into contact with young girls. He has a distaste for the formal meetings that occur at parties which, to him, deaden and formalize the interactions between the sexes. His initial encounter with Cordelia is random, but the rest of his endeavors are carefully calculated. He tracks her down and finds out everything about her life. He machinates a false friendship and false engagement. In the end he gets what he wants out of Cordelia and, having no further use for her, moves on to his next target.

                <em>The Aesthetic Validity of Marriage</em> is a letter written by B, a married judge by the name of Vilhelm, to A in defense of marriage, marking the beginning of part two. B is a proponent of the ethical life, but is trying to convince A that one can live both ethically and aesthetically. Romantic love is immediate and particular, “to see her and to love her were one and the same”. The smile from a girl you encounter by chance on the street is intoxicating in the moment but fleeting, and totally unique. Marriage takes hard work to maintain because it is eternal, and is a near universal experience. It seems that marriage is purely in the ethical realm while A’s pursuits are purely aesthetic, but B does his best to defend the aesthetics of marriage: “You believe that only a restless spirit is alive, while all men of experience think only a quiet spirit truly lives. For you a turbulent sea is a picture of life, for me the still, deep water… Thus is married domesticity, quiet, modest, murmuring; not many <em>changements</em>, and yet, like that water, it is flowing, like that water it has melody, dear to the one that knows it, dear to him just because he knows it."

                In Equilibrium between the Aesthetic and the Ethical in the Development of Personality B gives A an either/or: live either ethically or aesthetically. He defines the aesthetic factor in a person as “that by which he is immediately what he is; the ethical factor is that by which he becomes what he becomes." He makes clear that the choice is not between good and evil; to choose between good and evil one must already have chosen to live ethically. One can fail to live ethically and be evil or succeed and be good, but to the aesthete such distinctions are meaningless. This seems to contradict B’s prior essay which attempted a synthesis between the aesthetic and the ethical. Perhaps B realized that his essay had failed to sway A and simply moved on.  He disputes A’s view of either/ors, that the choice is meaningless because you will regret both options, because not choosing is a choice itself. He likens it to a helmsman  who must decide how to steer his ship, knowing that it continues on its current path while he waits. It is in this section that we get an explicit critique of philosophy, of the Hegelian dialectic. B says that philosophy is even worse than A’s aesthetic view for at least A is concerned with action rather than mere contemplation. But like A, Hegel’s philosophy doesn’t allow for either/ors. All of history can be mediated into a higher unity so it is irrelevant what choices you make. Start a war, don’t start a war, it doesn’t matter, all will be mediated I might say. B goes on to discuss the focus on the internal and external when developing the self. He critiques the mystic who expects nothing from the world and everything from himself and the aesthete who expects everything from the world and nothing from himself. In his middle ground, the ethical, one develops oneself internally in the context of the world.

                In the <em>Last Word</em>, B introduces A to a sermon written by an older priest friend of his called <em>The Edifying in the Thought that Against God We Are Always in the Wrong</em>. The simple interpretation is that being wrong is painful but edifying because we learn from it and hopefully do better in the future. To understand the full picture, imagine if a random person did you wrong; it would be natural and preferable to think that you were in the right. But if a loved one did you wrong the opposite would be true; it would be painful to think that you were in the right and they were in the wrong. It would be edifying to think you were wrong and they were right. Wanting to be in the wrong expresses an infinite relationship – you care more about the other person than yourself; you care more about the relationship than winning an argument. However, there is a contradiction because while you want to be wrong, you know you are right. This leads us to the edifying in the thought that against God we are always in the wrong; just like with your loved one you do your best to act the right way while always not only hoping (against a fellow human) but knowing (against God) that you are in the wrong. But is it not anesthetizing to always want to be in the wrong? You might expect that, if you think you are always in the wrong, there is no point in trying to do right. This is incorrect – think again of arguing with a loved one; always wanting to be in the wrong doesn't make you try any less hard to be in the right. This thought "stays the doubt and alleviates its anxiety, it puts one in heart and inspires one to action." If you always think that you’re correct, there is no impetus for change. Acknowledging that against God we are always in the wrong is edifying because it allows us to be in the vulnerable position of admitting our shortcomings while still striving to be great.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sermon ends with the clause “for only the truth that edifies is truth for you.” This is the ethical answer to Kierkegaard’s question posed in his diary – what is my purpose, what is truth for me? To the ethicist it is to improve oneself, to become what one becomes. The aesthetic philosophy is to not have a philosophy, to stop before you begin (from An ecstatic lecture in the <em>Diapsalmata</em>) – “whether or not you marry, you will regret both.” I read <em>Either/Or</em> as Kierkegaard’s struggle with this question and so no definitive answers are given. I myself lean towards B’s ethical view but many moderns prefer A. I guess I don’t understand why a synthesis between the aesthetic and the ethical can’t be made. A disdains those who make paltry attempts at enjoying the aesthetics of life, but given the choice between this synthesis and a purely ethical view I don’t see why one shouldn’t try to capture both values. One could argue that the combination of each watered down view is lesser than the full commitment to the ethical but this doesn’t seem right in my experience. If anything one tends to see people living either a both/and or a neither/nor lifestyle.
