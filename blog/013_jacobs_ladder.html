    *Spoilers* This was prompted by the 10+ IMDB reviewers who did not understand what this movie was about and were upset/surprised by the “twist”. If you know how the movie ends you can see symbols and little details in every single scene that foreshadow and support it. Off the top of my head:
</p>
<p>
    Opening scene in subway<br>
Jacob is asleep (hint that we are in his mind – where was he coming from? What was he doing right before?) and misses his stop, when he gets off the train he finds that the exit is closed off. (He is trapped in his mind, not dead but also not quite alive) He tries crossing the tracks to see if he can exit on the other side but a train appears and nearly hits him (light at the end of the tunnel, hint that his life is ending) but he jumps out of the way just in time (hint that he is still fighting to survive). Oh, he’s also carrying around a copy of The Stranger.
</p>
<p>
    Jezebel sex scene<br>
Solidifying the biblical connection – Jezebel as a seductress and false prophet.
</p>
<p>
    Burning of Jacob’s pictures of family<br>
Jacob must let go of his memories and attachments to be released from purgatory to heaven. See the angel chiropractor’s quote which explicitly lays this all out. (“your memories, your attachments, they burn them all away”)

</p>
<p>
    Party/palm reader<br>
Palm reader literally tells Jacob he’s dead, and Jezebel is upset that she’s with him. We also see Jezebel seducing another man.
</p>
<p>
    Dead doctor<br>
The fact that the doctor doesn’t exist (we later learn he died) and the receptionist can’t find Jacob’s file further suggest that this isn’t reality. When Jacob sees the demonic nature of the receptionist I interpret this as an example of a demon (or angel, depending on how you view it) erasing Jacob’s life.
</p>
<p>
    Jacob’s fever<br>
The fever represents demons burning his life away. Jezebel gets him to resist and helps him by cooling him down with ice. It is interesting that fire, normally associated with evil/hell, is actually good while the cool, soothing ice is evil.
</p>
<p>
    In bed with Sarah (wife)<br>
Extension of fever scene, Jacob feels cold and wants to warm himself with more sheets.
</p>
<p>
    Hospital/descent to hell<br>
    Hospital workers wheel Jacob down to the basement (hell) and tell him he is dead. Jacob denies this vehemently; I wonder though that if he hadn’t, would he have ended up in hell? Jezebel is there, as if we needed any more hints about who she is.

    Chiropractor reveals all<br>
    “The only part of you that burns in hell is the part of you that won’t let go of your life. Your memories, your attachments, they burn ‘em all away. But they’re not punishing [Eckhart] said. They’re freeing your soul… If you’re frightened of dying and you’re holding on, then you’ll see devils tearing your life away. But if you’ve made your peace, then the devils are really angels freeing you from the Earth.”

    Ascent to heaven with son, death of Jacob<br>
    Jacob lets go and joins Gabe in heaven. In the next and final scene Jacob dies in real life.

    The way I initially read the whole army drug conspiracy part of the movie was that it was Jacob’s subconscious coming up with a reason to continue to fight and not let go of his life. The weakness of this reading is that it seems like his fellow army mates are “real”, plus the movie just spends a lot of time on this subplot. I guess it depends on whether purgatory is an external place where Jacob’s and the other dead soldiers’ souls are or if it exists solely in Jacob’s mind. I don’t know what the orthodox Christian position on this is but the opening scene led me to believe that it is in Jacob’s mind. If this is correct then I like my initial reading. If not, then it is possible that there really was a drug induced murder fest and that the “ladder” creator who found Jacob is also dead. He is haunted by his creation and thus remains in purgatory until Jacob arrives; it would be interesting to know if his soul was freed after his confession. Also, if Jacob’s unit was drugged, does that make “purgatory”, i.e. the vast majority of the film, a hallucination? I think the purgatory reading is compatible with Jacob being murdered by a drugged American but there is an ambiguity here. I didn’t like the after-text about how the Pentagon denied using BZ. The film was a beautiful creation in it’s own right and that weird addition left a bad taste in my mouth.
