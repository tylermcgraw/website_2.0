            <h1><em>Submission</em>, by Michel Houellebecq</h1>
            <p>11/2/21</p>
            <p>
                Michel Houellebecq's <em>Submission</em> gives the first person perspective of Francois, a professor living through the election of France's first Islamic president. The novel has been accused of sexism, Islamophobia, and playing on popular fears in Europe, the last of which Houellebecq himself has admitted ("Yes... I use scare tactics"). I think the Islamophobic charges miss the point of <em>Submission</em> however - I read Houellebecq as critiquing Western enlightenment values, and while I don't think he is pro-Islam per se he definitely sees it as an improvement. As for the sexism, well, in my reading he is clearly guilty, but he is not a misogynist. That is, he isn't prejudiced against women, he just doesn't believe that they should be treated the same as men. He rejects feminism on the ground that it is simply unsustainable from a demographic point of view and portrays women as being more fulfilled and happy after the Islamization of society.

                The contrast between two dinners illustrates what a women's role could look like. In the first, a stressed, over-worked woman struggles to prepare a meal for friends while dealing with her child and drunk husband. In the second, a former professor is described as "thriving" as she serves up delicious homecooked dishes. The difference in garb makes a similar point; Muslim women cover themselves in public and dress sexily in private while Western women dress to impress in public and wear baggy comfort clothes in private. These depictions are blatantly and stereotypically sexist but reveal that our focus on individualism and equality can have negative consequences. Most of us in the Western world would say that these are fundamental values whose benefits outweigh any potential costs, but allowing ourselves to see the cracks in our philosophy is a win in Houellebecq's book ("I accelerate history... I condense an evolution that is, in my opinion, realistic.")

                I couldn't help but notice that submission played a big role in <em>Breakfast at Tiffany's</em>, which I watched shortly after finishing the novel. Holly (Hepburn) is a free spirit and abhores feeling caged by her relationships. She clearly loves Paul, the writer, but when he says "you belong to me" Holly pushes back. A modern viewer might see this as a positive, indicative of Holly's independence and strength. "People don't belong to people" as Holly says. But this apparent individuality only leads to shallow, unfulfilling relationships that never lead to anything meaningful. (Just like with the protagonist, Francois) By submitting to nothing, Holly implicitly believes that there is nothing worthy of submission. Paul puts it beautifully in the final scene: "People do fall in love. People do belong to each other. Because that's the only chance anybody's got for real happiness."

                Of course, the problem with Islam (in <em>Submission</em> and some but not all Islamic societies) is that submission is a one way street. Women submit to men but not the other way around. Men submit to God so it's not as if they are beholden to nothing like Holly, but this uneven relationship is clearly incompatible with Western values. Houellebecq said that the original title of the novel was <em>The Conversion</em>. The fact that he changed it to <em>Submission</em> says to me that the idea of having something worthy of submitting to is more important than the details of Islam or any particular religion. Thus I read the novel in the negative as an indignment on Westernism rather than in the positive as an attack on Islam.

                I quite enjoyed this novel. I can understand why some are turned off by the sexism or the numerous mentions of Francois' penis. And I believe the only mention of America is when Francois notes the difference between what French and American men say when they come. ("<em>'Oh putain!' 'Oh putain je jouis!'</em>: more or less what you'd expect from a nation of regicides, more intense and beautiful from those true believers the Americans ('Oh my God! 'Oh Jesus Christ!')) I personally found Francois' inner dialogue to be hilarious and I think Houellebecq offers a critique worth pondering; it would be a mistake to discard this work because of its depiction of women or Islam.

                "The fact is, most people live their lives without worrying too much about these supposedly philosophical questions. They think about them only when they're facing some kind of tragedy - a serious illness, the death of a loved one. At least, that's how it is in the West; in the rest of the world people die and kill in the names of these very questions, they wage bloody wars over them, and they have since the dawn of time. These metaphysical questions are exactly what men fight over, not market shares or who gets to hunt where."
