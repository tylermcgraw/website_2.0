            <h1>What I've been watching: <em>300, Dune, Breakfast at Tiffany's, The French Dispatch, </em>and <em>Gone with the Wind</em></h1>
            <p>11/8/21</p>
            <h2>
                <em>300</em>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Who would have thought that Hollywood could make a great conservative film? 300 has it all: the importance of honor, tradition,  disgust at the modern corruption of values, nativism, freedom, brotherhood, equating good with beautiful and bad with ugly, eugenics, coming-of-age rituals, duty, serving a higher purpose, and strength.

            <h2>
                <em>Dune</em>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Despite being as close to the book as an adaptation could hope to get, Dune loses some of the themes and depth of the book. We still get a sense of the importance of culture, purpose, and destiny but much of the scale is lost despite the grand cinematography and score by Villenueve and Zimmer. It would be impossible to capture Dune in 2 hours and the movie is great given this constraint, but one cannot help but see it in the shadow of the truly epic original.

            <h2>
                <em>Breakfast at Tiffany's</em>
            </h2>
            <p>
                A decent film made nearly unwatchable with the over the top stereotypical Japanese landlord. My experience was influenced by recently reading <em>The Second Mountain</em> and <em>Submission</em> (see my post on Houellebecq's novel). Aside from Hepburn's whirlwind performance Moon River is what I'll be thinking about from this film. Frank Sinatra has a cover that surpasses the original; Frank Ocean's cover is how I discovered the song and the film but unfortunately is the worst version.

            <h2>
                <em>The French Dispatch</em>
            </h2>
            <p>
                <em>The French Dispatch</em> brings back much of the cast from <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em> as well as, of course, Anderson's unique and beautiful style. Every frame is a piece of art as Anderson explores journalism, ennui, being a foreigner, and French culture in a series of vignettes. Also brought back is Anderson's story within a story which is all the more fitting for the subject at hand.

            <h2>
                <em>Gone with the Wind</em>
            </h2>
            <p>
                <em>Gone with the Wind</em> is epic not because of compelling imagery or music like Dune but by being about everything. Love, honesty, honor, war, slavery, selflessness, money, land, family, death, the list goes on. Being nearly 4 hours probably helped but even so the character development and scale of the film was very impressive.
