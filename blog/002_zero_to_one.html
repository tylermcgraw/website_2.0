<h1><em>Zero to One</em>, by Peter Thiel</h1>

    Peter Thiel's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18050143-zero-to-one"><em>Zero to One: Notes on Startups, Or How to Build the Future</em></a> is, ostensibly, about how to create companies that build new things (or go from 0 to 1, to borrow Thiel's term of art). Of course, he can't tell you what exactly you need to do to create something new or else it would already exist, but he goes over the mindset, skills, and priorities you need to have to put yourself in a position to be a successful founder. There are plenty of unintuitive and contrarian points - just look at the names of some of the chapters: All Happy Companies are Different, Last Mover Advantage, If You Build it, Will They Come? To Thiel, contrarian thought is the only unique thought. And unique thought is in short supply these days if you are to believe Thiel's claims about current US indefinite optimism (a future which we have no control over) or Chinese and European pessimism.
</p>
<p>
    This was definitely the weakest part of the book, at least to me. Is it generally accepted that we have lost the optimism of a definite future of the 50's and 60's? (To be clear I genuinely don't know, perhaps this is a well known fact) Thiel tells the story of today's young adults collecting extracurricular activities and building a diverse resume in light of a perceived indefinite future, pursuing, in his view, "many-sided mediocrity". Funnily enough I am currently reading David Epstein's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range"><em>Range</em></a> which makes the opposite case - that we are pushing children to specialize far too early and that it is better to be a generalist in today's world - which I found to be quite a bit more compelling. Epstein doesn't address the zeitgeist of the day so perhaps Thiel is correct about this larger cultural shift, but it seemed like a bold claim to accept at face value.
</p>
<p>
    Back to the main thesis. While unique thought is necessary to make something new, it certainly isn't sufficient. Enter Thiel's philosophy for what makes a successful startup:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Create something new
        <p>
            As Thiel says, the next tech billionaire won't create an operating system or social network. If you are copying something that already exists, the best outcome you can hope for is to make a slightly better version. That's great, but there is significant competition in existing markets that makes it unlikely that you will emerge as the sole victor.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Create something that people want
        <p>
            Creating something new is necessary but not sufficient. This mirrors what I typically hear from vcs - something along the lines of customer obsession being the most important thing they look for in a startup.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        People
        <p>
            Thiel goes on about how everyone at PayPal was an outsider and how the best founders have an inverted U shaped personality, i.e. they exist at the extreme of any given trait axis. It would be interesting to see empirical data on this - I'm sure there's some truth to it but it seemed like Thiel just picked a few high profile examples and then make hand-sweeping claims. Oh, and also you should model your startup like a cult.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Start small
        <p>
            It is better to dominate a small market and then expand than to try to dominate a large market. If a large market already exists, that means there is ruthless competition and a higher barrier to entry. Think Facebook starting with college students or PayPal with Ebay vendors.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Sales
        <p>
            If you build it, they will not come. Sales is apparently underrated in the valley, but again this is a general hand-sweeping claim based on a stereotype of hacker culture. More interesting was the insight that personal sales works for large deals and broad marketing and advertising for cheaper products, but that there is a dead zone in the middle (e.g. where small businesses exist).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Monopolize
        <p>
            If you've created something new that people want with the right people and can dominate a small market, scaling up will have a flywheel effect of increasing your dominance if you can take advantage of some or all of these effects:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Network effects - the more users you have, the more valuable your product is</li>
            <li>Economies of scale - marginal costs of building more of the product is small</li>
            <li>Branding - I agree with Thiel that this comes with a strong underlying product, but can be bolstered</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Note that strategies such as vertical integration and commoditizing your complement weren't discussed, presumably because Thiel is (rightly) more concerned with how to create a new business that becomes a monopoly by its own bootstraps rather than how to form a moat around an existing dominant business.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    I agree with Thiel's main point that creating new things is what drives progress and that it takes bold, original thought to enact such change. I also thought he made some interesting points about competition - I have always had a very negative view of anti-competitive behavior so it was interesting to see some downsides of competition (e.g. the unhealthy extremes people will take to get a competitive edge) and potential upsides of monopolies (Thiel is careful to limit this to "creative" monopolies that add new value where non existed previously). The argument reminds me of Facebook's monopoly on social networks. Whistleblower Frances Haugen, who recently released damning documents against Facebook, wants the government to regulate rather than break up Facebook (which would increase competition and reduce resources for fighting disinformation, hate/violence, etc). For better or worse, regulation would only further entrench Facebook by raising the barrier to entry for startups. After reading the book I learned that Thiel has an article titled "The Straussian Moment" so perhaps there was a deeper message that went over my head. Then again, he seems to value and take pride in not only having contrarian ideas, but sharing them openly with the world. At least the socially acceptable ones.
