            <h1>Top 10 Albums of All Time</h1>
            <p>2/10/22</p>

            <p>
                <b>
                    1. To Pimp a Butterfly (Kendrick Lamar)<br>
                </b>
                An incredible concept, deeply personal, beautifully fused jazz and hip hop, with intricate word play. His previous album, good kid, m.A.A.d. city, is one of the great rap albums which only makes this feat more impressive. This is the kind of work that can only be listened to with one’s full attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
                    2. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (Kanye West)<br>
                </b>
                I could easily have fit several more of West’s albums into the top 10 but wanted more variety. I prefer new Kanye to old but the college dropout trilogy are classics, 808s & Heartbreak and Yeezus redefined the sound of the era, and Kids See Ghosts remains criminally underrated. Yet MBDTF is his magnum opus. The associated music film Runaway is also not to be missed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
                    3. Undun (The Roots)<br>
                </b>
                Another concept album, Undun tells the reverse chronological story of Redford Stevens, a name taken from a Sufjan Stephens song and based on friends of Roots members and Avon Barksdale from The Wire. I wrote a 10 page essay on the album in college and only began to scratch its surface.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
                    4. Blonde (Frank Ocean)<br>
                </b>
                Frank Ocean has such a beautiful voice that one can listen to his melancholy songs even in the best of moods. Despite his vulnerability on wax there is a mystique about Ocean, a distance, that is unusual for modern celebrities.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
                    5. Swimming (Mac Miller)<br>
                </b>
                I much prefer the introspective, emotional Mac to the young, immature Mac (I feel the same way about Tyler the Creator). Swimming reveals his struggle and recovery, which is all the more devastating with the knowledge of his overdose later that year.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
                    6. Plastic Beach (Gorillaz)<br>
                </b>
                Damon Albarn of the virtual band Gorillaz successfully adapted the rich literary genre of dystopian sci-fi to music with Plastic Beach. There are also incredible visuals for most of his (their) work.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
                    7. Madvillainy (Madvillain)<br>
                </b>
                Madvillain is the duo of MF DOOM and Madlib. They are among the best rappers and producers of all time, respectively, and Madvillainy lives up to their names. Not for the first time rap listener; it is hard to appreciate what they are doing without some experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
                    8. Deltron 3030 (Deltron 3030)<br>
                </b>
                Deltron 3030 is a fictional group, like the Gorillaz. The album is conceptual with a futuristic hip hop sci-fi fusion theme and Del the Funky Homosapien on the mic, what’s not to like?
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
                    9. IV (BADBADNOTGOOD)<br>
                </b>
                I wanted to include BADBADNOTGOOD’s mix for Late Night Tales but alas it’s not an album. BBNG have amazing covers of hip hop songs and collaborations with artists like Tyler the Creator and MF DOOM. IV is my favorite album of theirs, and features vocals from Samuel Herring (of Future Islands – check out Seasons (Waiting on You)), Mick Jenkins, and Charlotte Day Wilson.
            </p>

                <b>
                    10. 1999 (Joey Badass)<br>
                </b>
                My favorite mixtape of all time. Wayne is still the king of mixtapes but 1999 was the first one I listened to 5 years ago and is the one I still go back to most. Wayne’s Da Drought 3 is insane and close to an honorable mention.
            </p>

                Honorable Mentions

            <p>
                <b>
                    Donuts (J Dilla)<br>
                </b>
                My favorite producer, up there with Madlib, and a tier above DJ Shadow, Nujabes, and 9th Wonder.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
                    Cosmogramma (Flying Lotus)<br>
                </b>
                Psychedelic hip hop. He recently did the soundtrack for the anime Yasuke, the one bright spot in that unfortunate work.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
                    Illmatic (Nas)<br>
                </b>
                Classic, and has aged like fine wine. Most old school stuff is hard to listen now to but Illmatic is timeless.
