            <h1><em>Autobiography</em> by John Stuart Mill</h1>

                One of the main motivations of the autobiography was so that there would be “some record of an education which was unusual and remarkable, and which, whatever else it may have done, has proved how much more than it is commonly supposed may be taught, and well taught, in those early years which, in the common modes of what is called instruction, are little better than wasted.” John Stuart Mill’s father, historian and economist James Mill, had his son learn Greek at age 3 and read many of the great Greek works by 8. He learned Latin, mathematics, science, and history, and his father’s friends David Ricardo and Jeremy Bentham, leading economic thinkers, assisted in his education.

                I’ve always been interested in case studies of uniquely successful people with unusual pedagogical backgrounds. Michel Montaigne and the Polgar sisters come to mind. Montaigne’s father made him learn Latin as his native tongue and used games and conversation rather than solely study of great books, while Laszlo Polgar had his daughters study chess intensely from a young age. Of course, case studies suffer from a lack of generalizability, but it is interesting that many path-breakingly successful people had weird upbringings. Judit Polgar is the only woman to be ranked as a top 10 chess player, Montaigne pioneered a new way to write and express oneself, and JS Mill is among the greatest thinkers of the 19th century.

                Mill’s father turned away from religion, eventually concluding that “concerning the origin of things nothing whatever can be known.” Mill recalls that his father was surprised that Manichaean duality had not had a reemergence, given the evils present in the world. His father’s lessons on morality focused on virtue and temperance, drawing mainly from the Greeks. He was taught that morality concerned solely actions rather than motives: “Right and wrong, good and bad, he regarded as qualities solely of conduct – of acts and omissions; there being no feeling which may not lead, and does not frequently lead, either to good or bad actions: conscience itself, the very desire to act right, often leading people to act wrong.” Mill continued to read the great works, learn from his father and his father’s contemporaries, and reached a turning point when he started writing his own essays and giving speeches.

                Mill identified his purpose early on as being a “reformer of the world”, but had a mental crisis (what we would now call depression) when he was 20 years old. He asked himself, “Suppose that all your objects in life were realized; that all the changes in institutions and opinions which you are looking forward to, could be completely effected at this very instant: would this be a great joy and happiness to you? And an irrepressible self-consciousness distinctly answered, ‘No!’ At this my heart sank within me: the whole foundation on which my life was constructed fell down.” He has a great passage on the etiology of his crisis that argues that analysis has a dissolving influence on feeling and that his education did not sufficiently strengthen the pleasure and pain associated with unnatural things (reading, writing, reforming) so that his “irretrievably analytic” mind could not make “fresh association of pleasure with any of the objects of human desire.” He specifically says that the “old familiar instruments” of reward and punishment only make artificial connections so they must be applied until the habit becomes inveterate and the associated feeling intense before education in analysis begins.

                The rest of the book details Mill’s second great influence, his longtime friend and eventual wife Harriet Taylor, and an overview of the rest of his life. He had a great amount of respect for Taylor’s intellect and passion, and credits himself with the abstract ideas in his works but her with the “human element” starting with Principles of Political Economy and particularly in On Liberty. I don’t have much to say about the second half of the book but there were some nuggets I appreciated.

                “When I had taken in any new idea, I could not rest til I had adjusted its relations to my old opinions, and ascertained exactly how far its effect ought to extend in modifying or superseding them.”

                “I am now convinced, that no great improvements in the lot of mankind are possible, until a great change takes place in the fundamental constitution of their modes of thought. The old opinions in religion, morals, and politics, are so much discredited in the more intellectual minds as to have lost the greater part of their efficacy for good, while they have still life enough in them to be a powerful obstacle to the growing up of any better opinions on those subjects. When the philosophic minds of the world can no longer believe its religion, or can only believe it with modifications amounting to an essential change of its character, a transitional period commences, of weak convictions, paralysed intellects, and growing laxity of principle, which cannot terminate until a renovation has at least been effected in the basis of their belief, leading to the evolution of some faith, whether religious or merely human, which they can really believe: and when things are in this state, all thinking or writing which does not tend to promote such a renovation, is of very little value beyond the moment.”

                “I had formed with the ideas of the Coleridgians, of the German thinkers, and of Carlyle, all of them fiercely opposed to the mode of thought in which I had been brought up, had convinced me that along with much error they possessed much truth”

                “It was evident that the working people were so accustomed to expect equivocation and evasion from those who sought their suffrages, that when they found, instead of that, a direct avowal of what was likely to be disagreeable to them, instead of being offended they concluded at once that this was a person they could trust.”
